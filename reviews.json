Compilations of which are finding their way onto even the most esteemed criticos' mid-year best-of lists! Bootlegs! Their pissing-on-copyright-laws approach poetically mirrors-- and is, one might argue, made possible by-- the wonders of digital file-sharing! Bootlegs!</p>\n<p>Quasi-anonymous 2 Many DJs are the kings of the bootleg mountain. Otherwise known as Soulwax, the Belgian duo (brothers Stephen and David Dewaele) has released some of the genre's most popular MP3s, many of which sprang to notoriety after being posted to Boomselection, the web's primary resource for this new music. <em>As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2</em> is their first full-length release as bootleggers (they actually started out as a rock band), but genre classification aside, the album is really just a very cohesive, hour-long DJ mix. This incarnation of the 25-year-old artform, however, seems to be kicking up quite a bit of fuss amongst those 'in the know.' But what's the big deal? According to my analysis, four incredibly deep, insightful conclusions can be reached from the album's content:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All popular music is, by definition, pop music.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This has been the manifesto of the bootleg movement from day one, or at least since the Freelance Hellraiser's &quot;A Stroke of Genius&quot; started making the Internet rounds. Effortlessly merging the biggest hits of Christina Aguilera and The Strokes played a galactic prank on the hipsters of the world, showing that their latest pet band was just a few mouse clicks away from being the latest teenie pop sample loop. Nothing on <em>Radio Soulwax</em> is quite so subversive, but the integration of the thick-glasses crowd's favorite bands-- the Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Stooges-- into what's basically a club house mix might ruffle some feathers. Who would've known &quot;I'm Waiting for My Man&quot; was just a Sly &amp; The Family Stone tambourine away from being a party anthem? Who'd've thunk &quot;No Fun&quot; or &quot;Cannonball&quot; wrapped so perfectly around aged rap tracks from Salt N' Pepa and Skee-Lo? Nobody, actually, and that's part of the fun.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>DJ mixes are <em>not</em> just a novelty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Beyond this valiant mission, the dexterous wrists of 2 Many DJs appear to strive for even higher, more artistically lofty accomplishments with their mix. Witness, for example, the middle 20 minutes of the album, a movement largely devoid of mainstream-recognizable tunes. Dropping music from the household-name likes of Funkacise Gang, Alphawezen, and Zongamin, the duo slaps rhythm against rhythm in calculated haphazardry, creating new sounds sure to earn ever-more-arcane classifications from the self-appointed genre taxonomists. You might argue such experimentation is instant death to the album's boogie-boogie purpose, and is even  a bit middling. Or you might argue that I and others are convincing ourselves of this objective's presence in order to wax intellectual about a pop music collection. On certain occasions, I'd be obliged to agree with you.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>DJ mixes <em>are</em> just a novelty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because really: Dolly Parton into Rokysopp? Early New Order vs. house sleazeballs Detroit Grand Pubahs? These are combinations designed to provoke disbelief and mirth on the first listen-- which they do, admirably. But thereafter, as with the vast majority of DJ mixes, the Law of Diminishing Entertainment Returns applies more readily-- these krazy kombos are certainly worth the download-time to hear at least once, but the audio trickery wears out fast. Compounding the problem is the inclusion of fairly pointless pre-processed kitsch, like the techno covers of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; and ELO's falsetto favorite &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot;. Choosing to include the electro-fied versions of <em>other</em> mixing board pranksters is surely an odd decision, and resembles smirking in a hall of mirrors, with all the fun-or-headache debate that implies. So what's the real, overarching \u00fcber-purpose?</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Hire us for remixes!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And hell, don't assume from our web address that I think there's anything wrong with a little self-promotion! 2 Many DJs show off their renovatin' stuff on <em>Radio Soulwax</em>, and their stuff ain't too shabby. Witness Destiny's Child's TRL fave &quot;Independent Women Pt 1,&quot; transformed into a 70s lite-funk groover by the addition of 10cc's &quot;Dreadlock Holiday.&quot; (Mere coincidence that Beyonce's movie-driven first solo step had similar funktastical leanings?) The duo also definitively proves that nothing goes with the gleefully self-aware over-the-top house of Basement Jaxx like the hilariously oblivious prog of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. The hybridization of &quot;Where's Your Head At&quot; and a live take on &quot;Theme from 'Peter Gunn'&quot; has got BANG!-- you can already envision Pringles' ad execs riffling their Rolodexes.</p>\n<p>Despite all my hypothesizing and yelling about stuff, I concede that <em>Radio Soulwax</em> is a good time. I don't know that it's groundbreaking, beyond the fact that whatever this bootlegging craze is the start of could eventually yield fantastic results. At this point, though, all I hear is a temporary house-party enhancer that, while fun for a while, isn't the kind of thing you're going to come back to in five years (or even two) to find that it's withstood the test of time. Enjoy it while you can.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Every genre's got its purists. For example, there's the three-chord wheeling, leather-studded punk mavens still preaching musical recklessness and revolution; the mascara-caked new wave gatekeepers now grown-up and working in accounting, still convinced Robert Smith and Morrissey are speaking directly to them; and your techno buffs, who just want things to stay the way they were-- in the year 2412. All are somewhat misguided in their attempts at genre preservation, but none foul it up like the hardcore blues camp. Isn't <em>real blues supposed to be about dungarees, crafting guitar slides from beer bottles, and literally selling your soul to the devil, <em>not</em> the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin?</em></p>\n<p>I bring this up because Lincolnshire's 22-20s (named after a classic Skip James blues song) have accrued more blues cred than BRMC, the White Stripes, and the Kills with their self-titled debut, an offering that seemingly reaches back only to Britain's 1960s usurpation of American blues. However, to actually gauge the blues &quot;purity&quot; of any blues-rock artist today would be pointless. Time would be better spent trying to prove &quot;1&quot; is closer to infinity than &quot;0&quot; than comparing modern bands' faithfulness to Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters. And that's just fine, because blues would still be a derelict in contemporary music if not for some harmless blaspheming.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the 22-20s' potency is inversely proportional to their incorporation of traditional blues. Sure, Rolling Stones and CCR are jumping-off points, but the auxiliary genre hopping really makes these songs sizzle. &quot;Shoot Your Gun&quot; and &quot;Such a Fool&quot; sneak in (gasp!) Beatlesque melodies and catchy Cheap Trick cock-pop. Despite its sapless lyrics (&quot;I'm getting bored/ Of putting on a smile&quot;), &quot;Baby Brings Bad News&quot; channels smarmy Britpop, hitting up mid-90s Blur for a wispy, piano-driven chorus. Exempting these three tracks, however, the band shrinks back into its shell, relying on automated blues-rock.</p>\n<p>Both &quot;Why Don't You Do It for Me&quot; and &quot;I'm the One&quot; are centered around a knee-slappin' blues lick, but botch opportunities to deliver an equally vibrant chorus and bridge, one of blues rock's most sacred cows. Then there's the rest, which is mostly rehashed Dylan and Fogerty, some innocuous Stevie Ray Vaughn knockoffs, and &quot;The Things That Lovers Do,&quot; a laughable regurgitation of Pearl Jam's &quot;Black.&quot; Yes, <em>NME's simultaneously shitting and pissing themselves, but the 22-20s evade most of the typical British rock potholes (i.e. histrionics, pretentiousness, unapologetic 60s-aping, among others), and can actually be taken at face value. Now if we could just touch-up the blemishes on that face...</em></p>\n",

May cause loss of patience in otherwise open-minded listeners.</em></p>\n<p>If you're already a fan of 23 Skidoo, you're probably wont to ignore that warning. You already know that, throughout their brief existence in the early 1980s, 23 Skidoo were an exceedingly inaccessible outfit, offering their clattering, mostly undanceable brand of noise-blighted funk in strictly linear doses. They rarely stuck with a groove for long, preferring instead to tease their audience with five-second bursts of straightforward rhythm and melody and shred expectations mere moments later. But even if you're intimately familiar with a record like their 1982 debut <em>Seven Songs</em>, you're not likely prepared for what's on this disc.</p>\n<p><em>Seven Songs</em> has justifiably been hailed lately as something of a classic of the post-punk era, a concise, pointed attack on the senses that contains most of the band's easiest listening in tightly governed chunks of collapsing funk. Their final album (discounting a 2000 reunion LP), 1984's <em>Urban Gamelan</em>, largely eschewed the harmonic elements of <em>Seven Songs</em> for a more bare-bones, percussion-focused approach to the sound, accented by the occasional relapse to white noise or sputtering bass. It's a far more abstract final product, and a difficult listen for those seeking some sort of immediate payoff.</p>\n<p>As uncompromising and abrasive as <em>Urban Gamelan</em> is, though, <em>The Culling Is Coming</em> makes it look like a hippie drum circle by comparison. Originally released between their other two albums, <em>The Culling</em> was never meant to embody a statement of purpose by the band, but instead to merely document a pair of live experiments in industrial noise-making (this reissue appends a third) for posterity. This helps explain why it's just now reaching CD for the first time, but it also helps explain why it's the one 23 Skidoo recording nobody ever really talks about.</p>\n<p>The performances themselves are entirely freeform explorations of pure sound, with no real sense of build or release, which is really where the disc falters as a listening experience. The first performance, given the over-arching name &quot;A Winter Ritual&quot;, was performed at Dartington Music College by brothers Johnny and Alex Turnbull, the band's two key members, using Gamelan, gongs, flute, and kendang drums, and it's the most straightforward section of the disc. The duo moves through a series of loose improvisations built on repetitive patterns performed on the Gamelan and Kendang, hanging snatches of nearly melodic flute just out of the listener's reach. Unfortunately, rather than use the intriguing textures they develop as building blocks for something bigger, only once do they actually choose to develop them, on &quot;G-3 Insemination&quot;, wherein some sort of tambourine-like percussion instrument is used to lend a sense of urgency to certain passages, thus giving at least a sense of development.</p>\n<p>&quot;A Summer Rite&quot; is much darker, inhabiting the same headspace as dark ambient pioneers Current 93 and Nurse with Wound. The Turnbulls are joined by Fritz Catlin, and all three are credited with &quot;Metal Percussion&quot;. Most of the sounds seems to be coming from tape manipulations, though, as crunching, buzzing, scraping and animalesque human utterances dominate the proceedings. The fact that this was recorded at the 1982 W.O.M.A.D. World Music Festival is almost funny-- I can't imagine what a W.O.M.A.D. audience must have thought of these guys, heads shaven clean, faces painted with camouflage patterns, assaulting them with a minimalist collage of inscrutable sound.</p>\n<p>&quot;Move Back - Bite Harder&quot;, the bonus offering on this reissue, is perhaps the most interesting, featuring a series of heavily manipulated looping vocal samples and fleeting snatches of squealing and incidental noise, but as it drags on for 27 minutes, it's hard to stay focused on it. <em>The Culling Is Coming</em> is of primary interest for devoted noiseniks, people with huge amounts of shelf space devoted to Throbbing Gristle, Clock DVA, Nurse with Wound, and the like. As a fan of 23 Skidoo and an admitted dabbler in the world of dark ambient and noise, I can't recommend <em>The Culling Is Coming</em> to anyone else, really, though it is an interesting document of a challenging band at their most confrontational.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Give Dave Huismans credit for this: his albums may fall short of brilliance, but with each one he at least finds a new way to do so. In the last five years, his work under his 2562 moniker mutated from restrained, minimalist dubstep (2009's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13622-unbalance/\"><em>Unbalance</em></a>) to disco-informed twitch-bass (2011's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15451-fever/\"><em>Fever</em></a>) to ambient techno infused with Middle Eastern atmosphere and field recordings (2012's <em>Air Jordan</em> EP)\u2014concepts that promised more than they delivered while still finding at least some prime real estate on dancefloor playlists. You could move to it, but good luck finding a real emotional connection inside those rhythmic lines.</p>\n<p>This time, 2562's method involves drawing in a glut of no wave, new age, coldwave, and whatever synthesized washes of overcast dystopian malaise he can bolt to a solid 4/4. That's given <em>The New Today</em> more of a human feeling than previous works\u2014even if said human feeling is shot through with a tense dread. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that it's one of those clinical exercises more focused on refining sounds than making them resonate as something actually alive. Listen to those six-minute builds crawl to a crest, key in to the vague bristle of an abstracted foreboding, but don't expect any moments of revelation. It's ambient techno at room temperature.</p>\n<p>It can be appealing in a purely scientific sense to go through and catalog each track's tactile qualities. Maybe it's because it follows a space-station hum of a clich\u00e9-riddled ambient opener (&quot;Arrival&quot;), but &quot;Terraforming&quot; quickly jumps out as a high point, nearly 10 minutes of giant-machine startup-process churn. Unexpected yet subtle intrusions of new age synth throw off the mood in an intriguing way, and elsewhere on the record contrasting elements jump out\u2014light pianos in the pistons-and-steam clutter of &quot;Cauldron&quot;, or the waning moments of &quot;Vibedoctor&quot; where treated vibraphones start frantically spilling all over one another.</p>\n<p>And yet the music is still distant, no matter how up-close the beats feel. Once the songs become familiar, the pleasures disappear along with the surprises. It's frustrating that Huisman is so skilled at crafing individual sounds but unable to put them all together. Someday, there might be a 2562 full-length with all this record's elusive textures, the unpredictability of <em>Fever</em>*'s* mutant-disco rhythms, and the deep warmth of <em>Unbalance</em>. In the meantime, it's another case of try again, fail again, fail better.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>For better and worse, electronic music cares about process. You wouldn't ever congratulate a friend who spent months getting his oven to function as a refrigerator, but anyone who can make a vacuum sound like an 808 can prepare for notoriety, if not outright praise. Artists such as Matthew Herbert, the Field, and Matmos have diced sounds until their notable sources are barely detectable. So it goes with 2562, whose third album, <em>Fever</em>, was inspired by disco music (hence the title) released in the late 1970s around the time of the producer's birth. It's probably a smart gambit for the producer: His first two albums, while well received, were more notable for expanding dubstep's geographical imprint (2562 is the postal code of the producer's home in the Hague) than its sonic one.</p>\n<p>Despite its roots-- every last sound here is sampled from disco records-- <em>Fever</em> is a fairly catholic dubstep set: Racketeering snares, ominous chord structures, and a vague melodic distension pervade the album. Still, you can hear the fruits of his labor, especially in comparison to 2009's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13622-unbalance/\"><em>Unbalance</em></a>. <em>Fever</em> is warmer, due both to its subtle vinyl crackle and the vague symphonic timbre that hovers whenever its minute samples are massed in melody. The persistent, four-on-the-floor clacking that propels &quot;Brasil Deadwalker&quot; is a visceral reminder of how techno and house borrowed and digitized disco's rhythmic structure. The anthemic opener &quot;Winamp Melodrama&quot; (great title) grabs a Gamble &amp; Huff hammer and bangs everything in sight. 2562 doesn't employ vocal samples very often, but on the album-closing title track he gathers several into a dense fog and achieves a kind of beauty rarely attempted elsewhere on the album.</p>\n<p>About that: <em>Fever</em>, like 2562's previous records, is hard music. There is no wobble in the bass or flutter in the melodies; they are presented as-is, with little space for the listener. <em>Fever</em> can sound plastic, unpliable at times. I can hear the echoes of those old disco records in these sounds, but I can't find any of the laughter, silliness, or goodwill that fueled them. 2562 spent a lot of time molding one genre of music into another: It's safe to say he cares about sound for sound's sake. Which is fine, but it also means that the process that drove <em>Fever</em>'s creation wasn't undertaken in an effort to illuminate the source material (it should be said that while most genres of dance music owe a healthy debt to disco, dubstep is really more of a third cousin than a granddaughter) or forge new territory. It was done as an exercise.</p>\n<p>So parts of <em>Fever</em>-- the bone-on-bone thwacks that close &quot;Flavour Park Jam&quot;, for instance-- are essentially just 2562 going through the motions: the tedious, musically rigorous motions. I adore the idea behind <em>Fever</em>, and the attempt to artistically bind oneself to a process like this is brave. But in boxing himself in, 2562 seems to have found just a new box, a constricted area where several of his compositions suffocate. Those that escape are enjoyable as some kind of tonally curious, hardscrabble bass music, which is where 2562 began in the first place.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Like most electronic dance genres, the centrality of anonymity to dubstep has been a bit overstated. The greatest strength of the genre right now is the fact that there's a unique niche for every producer, or at least those who deign to nichedom instead of making their name as a scene-hopping rhythmic polyglot. So there's something weirdly blank about the idea of a producer who, having already burned through a couple of other pseudonyms, decides to make his name as a post-dubstep figure by picking his own postal code as an alias.</p>\n<p>And that might be by design. 2562-- n\u00e9 Dave Huismans, aka A Made Up Sound-- has put the idea across that dubstep is more of a chassis than a full vehicle for his style, and it's not just the geographical distance from Croydon that sets his music apart. With an interest in a wide-spanning range of techno sounds and a background in broken beat, Huismans made his initial impacts with a pair of 2007 singles-- &quot;Channel Two&quot; and &quot;Kameleon&quot;-- that blended mutated, uptempo 2-step rhythms with glassy synths to compellingly frigid effect. And, as the album <em>Aerial</em> proved the following year, it was an aesthetic he was able to draw some intriguing cross-pollinations from, owing as much to classic Orbital as it did the latest sounds out of South London.</p>\n<p>But if his new album <em>Unbalance</em> is a progression, it's a regimented one. Where <em>Aerial</em> ran a wide BPM range, used chord progressions that fluctuated between ravey and ambient, and traded on a tension between static-filled negative space and percussive snap, <em>Unbalance</em> is a bit more confined and busy, establishing a narrow tempo window-- quickly paced, with little breathing room-- and sticking to it. It's one of those odd albums where nearly every track sounds good, but it's all so singleminded and monolithic in its approach that taking it in as a whole almost feels smothering.</p>\n<p>In single-serving doses, it's easy to get drawn in, and picking any individual track off this album will reveal its own unique touches: the keyboards hacked up into skipping-CD stutters that make up the melodic undercurrent of &quot;Flashback&quot;, the jump-cut vibes and mosquito Moogs in &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, the slow build of the title track from floating dead-satellite gristle to densely stammering percussion punctuated by panicked-sounding organ stab chords. And &quot;Love in Outer Space&quot;, the first single off the album, is one of Huismans' nerviest pieces of drum programming, a frenetic trap/kick/clap Benihana act that becomes only more jolting when a bank of borderline-acid synths jumps in to act as a manic counter-rhythm.</p>\n<p>In comparison to <em>Great Lengths</em>-- the latest album from his closest analogue, fellow countryman and stylistic shapeshifter Martyn-- 2562's latest is missing a bit in the area of soulfulness, or much of a human touch at all. That's a serious bonus if you're in the right mindframe; revisiting this album when it's 15 degrees out and it gets dark before 5 p.m. could do it some good. And in the search to find a specific track to single out as a detriment, I couldn't do much worse than finding analogues to tracks where he did certain tricks more deftly-- i.e., the conga drums on &quot;Narita&quot; being reminiscent of but not quite as lively as &quot;Kameleon&quot;. Just keep in mind that listening to this entire album's one-note routine in one sitting-- great as that note can be-- may lead you to believe that 2562 is more indistinct and anonymous than he really is.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's been over three years since 4 Hero released their last album, <em>Two Pages</em>, which has given them enough time to hob-knob about the industry and pool together enough guest musicians for their latest effort, <em>Creating Patterns</em>, a kind of &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul for Those That Gotta Get Their Minds Together.&quot; Apparently feeling pent-in by their simple designation as drum-n-bass luminaries, Dego and Marc Mac have decided to spread their ambitions far and wide, creating an album that harkens back to Stevie Wonder's <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> and Herbie Hancock's <em>Head Hunters</em>.</p>\n<p>4 Hero are obviously wizards in the studio; the production values and sounds they create are sterling. However, the topical concerns of <em>Creating Patterns</em> bring to mind an incredible array of -ism's-- eastern mysticism, religious syncretism and socially progressive, get-yer-ass-off-the-couch pragmatism, to name a few-- that come close to derailing the musical content. With nearly 30 years separating us from <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em>, the conceits contained there simply sound na\u00efve; here, they border more on the self-indulgent.</p>\n<p>My interest in <em>Creating Patterns</em> was largely piqued by the UK hype surrounding its release and its designation in more than one place as album-of-the-year. I was prepared to follow suit 30 seconds into the first track, &quot;Conceptions,&quot; when I was taken aback by the gorgeous mix of layered strings, sitar, and soprano sax over a loping bassline that wafted from the speakers like a shower of perfumed lotus petals. I eased back in my chair and let myself float away, prepared never to come back, except possibly as a Bodhisattva gushing praise for my new favorite album. But what followed was a let-down. Aside from &quot;Conceptions,&quot; there's really only one other track on the album that took me hook, line and sinker: &quot;Les Fleur.&quot; And even this song lost most of its luster when it revealed itself as a nearly note-for-note replica of Minnie Riperton's gorgeous song of the same name.</p>\n<p>My experience with <em>Creating Patterns</em> was consistently disrupted by lyrical contributions I found hard to swallow. &quot;Time&quot; features the ubiquitous Ursula Rucker spoiling a perfectly good arrangement with her open-mic-night voyage of spiritual conflict, which is only enlightening insofar as it displays how much more convenient it is for a poet to ransack the Old Testament than to try to say something original.</p>\n<p>Mark Murphy's performance on &quot;Twelve Tribes&quot; is far more convincing and I loved his delivery. But it also includes lines like, &quot;Twelve, the infinite number/ All of us are twelve once and then never the same/ Twelve opens the eyes and the mind/ We learn more between the ages of twelve and eighteen than we ever again experience in learning/ The Mayan calendar ends in 2012/ What, then?/ Hmm? Hmm?&quot; I assume we're supposed to find this incredibly mind-blowing. Maybe after smoking a few bowls. (&quot;2012! Dude, what a bummer! We'd better have this all smoked by then-- we don't want it to go to waste.&quot;) If you can ignore the silliness, though, it's a great track that rivals Medeski, Martin and Wood's &quot;Whatever Happened to Gus?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Another Day&quot; features Jill Scott, and it's kind of odd hearing a woman that sounds like Anita Baker sing about how, although she'd rather stay home and play video games than go to work, by god, she's going to push forward and make something of herself. &quot;Unique&quot; turns things around with Brazilian-tinged instrumentation and Portuguese vocals, and &quot;The Day of the Greys,&quot; an epic, folk-inflected number, keeps the record riding at a passable level. &quot;Hold It Down&quot; might even appeal to fans of Lauryn Hill and straight ahead R&amp;B.; But then there are the numerous unpleasant excursions into jazz fusion like &quot;Twothesme,&quot; &quot;Golden Solitude,&quot; and &quot;Eight,&quot; which grind away repetitively to the point of a mind-numbing, next-song-please anxiety.</p>\n<p><em>Creating Patterns</em> left me disappointed, and feeling that the album could have amounted to much more. A shame, because 4 Hero are creating some of the most startling studio sounds I've come across. The string arrangements that back the tracks here remind me of the golden age of 70s soul, smooth and well-crafted. The beats are crisp and catchy, and the scope of the album is ambitious, even though, in the end, that ambition proves to be its biggest weakness. I'll be looking forward to their next effort, hoping they decide to trust their own talents and go it alone.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>What does &quot;deep&quot; mean? House music has been earnestly applying its wiki brainpower to this question for a couple of years now, processing decades of house and disco tropes and rendering an endless stream of variations upon the theme. Record after record aspires to the ideal type, with just the right balance of disco breaks, vintage-sounding drum machines, blocky piano chords, and suggestively yearning vocals. This goes for a lot of crappy records, but it also holds for some of the good ones, too. The debut album from Scotland's <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/6thboroughproject\">6th Borough Project</a> feels, in many ways, like a quintessentially of-the-moment dissertation on deepness; fortunately, it falls to the worthwhile end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>I don't think that 6th Borough Project-- the duo of house producers Graeme Clark, aka the Revenge, and Craig Smith-- would dispute their role as a certain kind of revivalist (or, better, caretaker, preservationist, gene-splicer). It's right there in the introduction to &quot;Deep C&quot;, where a stoned-sounding voice intones, &quot;Nothing is original. All human expression is really just endless variations. There are only a limited number of stories you can tell, but there's an unlimited number of ways to tell the same story.&quot;</p>\n<p>Their story is a kind of idealized version of classic, disco-infused house, chock full of soul samples as super-saturated as old Polaroids. (I realize that we used up that metaphor on chillwave, but it does beg the question: Is house music's current retro fetish a manifestation of the same rearview-yearning currently running through indie music? Possibly.) They've definitely got a certain formula down: Tracks start off demurely, with a simple boom/clap drum pattern and a bass line, maybe a flickering loop of voice or guitar; then they swell about the middle, adding layers of keyboards and carefully daubing on more samples, like horn and voices. The climax often consists of a clipped phrase unrolling itself to its full length, a pocket in time before the groove kicks back in and the track disassembles itself, piece by piece. It's music made with a DJ's sense of sequencing, which is also a way of saying that it's largely about balance. And, make no mistake, it can be thrilling, especially when they slow down and linger on the contours of their source material, luxuriating in the wobble of a drum fill or the silvery arrow of a delay chain.</p>\n<p>6th Borough Project and the Revenge are often counted as adherents to a slow-mo tendency in house music (along with Mark E, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/\">John Talabot</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/\">Nicolas Jaar</a> and the Wolf + Lamb crew, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/\">Prins Thomas</a> and his Internasjonal label, among others), but not everything here is quite so downbeat. Perhaps half the tracks could fit into the second hour of any dance party-- or even the 11th, depending upon the club. &quot;Find a Way&quot; is a driving filter-disco number, all jangly guitar and throaty exhortation, that could crack the cinderblocks in a basement dive; the percussive &quot;Iznae&quot; is spacious but powerful, with bass and drums that thump your sternum, sampled snares leaning forward into the beat. (The album's least typical cut, it's also one of the best.) But &quot;If the Feeling's Right&quot; and &quot;Deep C&quot; both sink into wonderfully woozy territory, with blurry disco samples and synthesizers congealing around stumbling 4/4 kicks and handclaps. With its synths and vocoders, &quot;Deep C&quot; sounds like an experiment in new wave disco, maybe with a touch of Mike Oldfield's &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mwk4NGEiNI\">In High Places</a>&quot;; &quot;If the Feeling's Right&quot; shuffles along the border between exhaustion and ecstasy, spurred on by keening vocal loops.</p>\n<p>Back to nostalgia: the guys in 6th Borough Project know what they're doing. The name itself falls in line with classic house and disco monikers like Terrence Parker's Seven Grand Housing Authority and Began Cekic's Brooklyn Express; it gives off the same scent of sun-baked concrete and sweaty basements. It's not an original image of urban America, but then, nothing is original. 6th Borough Project repeat themselves sometimes, but they've got a solid grasp of the story they've chosen to tell. Somewhere, someone's writing a variation on one of their variations right now. The parts of this album where they depart from the script are enough to make me curious about how they'll respond.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In the late 1980s, <a href=\"http://www.808state.com/\">808 State</a> asked themselves a couple of important questions: Was it possible to get the masses to rise up and embrace instrumental beatscapes? Could a couple of guys with a couple of keyboards become a pop group without ever really writing pop songs? Should a house or techno act even bother releasing an album aimed at a general audience? There was no real evidence that the answer to any of these questions was &quot;yes,&quot; but 808, along with a handful of other ambitious crossover types, persisted anyway. Thanks to a mixture of luck, timing, and skill, 808 actually succeeded. And more than an any other crossover 1990s dance act, they stayed true to both their club and avant-electronic roots. The career-spanning <em>Blueprint</em> proves that 808 did have a certain commercial instinct almost from the start. What's more surprising is how big they scored with the stuff on <em>Blueprint</em> that sounds the <em>least</em> commercial.</p>\n<p>808 came up in the early days of British rave by making intense and dense compositions that represented club music at its furthest-out, anticipating the kind of abstract hardcore electronica that didn't quite exist just yet. It's a thrillingly manic and claustrophobic sound, enough so that it inspired more than a few future IDM tyros. On the other hand, it's unsurprising that the caustic acid maximalism of &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49P4GUA4AIY\">Flow Coma</a>&quot; never charted. 808's next single, however, hit in the biggest possible way. Relaxing a bit, like rave as a whole for a brief second, they scored massively with the platonically placid &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxDRePUwEY\">Pacific State</a>&quot;. The tune that helped to enshrine both the saxophone and the birdcall as part of the softer side of dance music's vocabulary, &quot;Pacific&quot; still has enough of techno's antic bounce to make it seem like a great lost direction for pop, where hippie relaxation vibes and bright video game funk are not incompatible.</p>\n<p>An accountant probably would have told them to ride their status as chill-out pioneers until it stopped being profitable, which could have lasted at least until <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/\">Moby</a> smothered the trend stone-dead with the success of <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/\">Play</a></em>. Instead 808 released a few charmingly clunky takes on hip-house that are left out on <em>Blueprint</em>. That certainly helps the collection's flow, even if it does underline why the group calls this their &quot;greatest bits&quot; rather than a complete overview. When they finally rebounded, creatively, it once again paid off commercially. &quot;Pacific&quot; and their Brit-rap adventures had clearly given them an appreciation for ideas of beauty and fun that conformed to 99 percent of humanity's. But they never quite lost their taste for the robots-in-meltdown fierceness of &quot;Flow Coma&quot;. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRlZQRRGD8o\">Cubik</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIA2ddd8Bo\">In Yer Face</a>&quot; were among the 808's biggest non-&quot;Pacific&quot; hits, but they were also among their rawest tunes. The difference is that the intensity now felt brash and joyful rather than hermetic and kinda creepy.</p>\n<p>But the fact that one of 808's albums was called <em>Gorgeous</em> should give you an indication that their sympathies ultimately lay more with &quot;Pacific State&quot; than &quot;In Yer Face&quot;. Gorgeousness as an end in itself sometimes led 808 to slick and forgettable tracks like &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9B2ybeAX2Y\">Plan 9</a>&quot;, which has as much passion and inventiveness as the house-as-high-end-hotel-muzak they unfortunately helped inspire. But even &quot;Plan 9&quot; doesn't outstay its welcome. Early adopters of the &quot;radio edit&quot; approach to taking electronic dance into the mainstream, even 808's opulent ambient stuff almost always has an instrumental earworm to get you humming. So, in addition to being just damn listenable, front to back, <em>Blueprint</em>'s also fascinating as a look at one group's answer to Brit dance culture's warring impulses in the 90s. 808's most memorable music is never split between opulent ambiance designed for the laid-back appreciation of connoisseurs and rugged slabs of computer madness to pump the adrenaline of young folks juiced on rave's novelty. The two are almost always mixed up into the same tunes, the wild beat constructions complimented by a real musical richness. That's probably why they've endured, while so many one-note singles from 808's peers have faded away.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/34149-9t-antiope/\">9T Antiope</a>, the duo of Nima Aghiani and Sara Bigdeli Shamloo, hail from Tehran and live in Paris, and from the sound of this self-released EP, they may as well be time travelers, for all we know. Part of their sound is very old: Shamloo\u2019s singing bears traces of medieval European folk music, and her lyrics often resemble scraps of heroic verse, full of chariots and faeries and peppered with literary allusions. But Aghiani\u2019s electronic production hurtles back at us from a distant future: digital static, dissonant chirps, the incomprehensible crackle of an AI crunching numbers. The results are eerie and enrapturing, like an itinerant bard warming her hands over a pile of burning dot-matrix printers.</p>\n<p>Even though she never sings unaccompanied, the majority of the four-track EP scans, functionally, as a cappella music. Shamloo\u2019s voice not only carries the melody; her singing is virtually the only tonal element here, and the occasional harmonies that she produces in combination with the flickering background buzz resemble someone singing over the drone of a walk-in cooler.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Aghiani\u2019s electronics balance the flat, affectless grey of a dead television with piercing sine waves and pinprick bursts of color. \u201cDen\u201d begins with two minutes of clanking metal, electrical hum, and panning static; in the background, a crow caws once and falls silent. In these long moments, his ambient industrial soundscapes have the vivid, mimetic feel of a radio play. The gurgling oscillators of \u201cBrute\u201d resemble Bebe and Louis Barron\u2019s *Forbidden Planet *score. The four tracks work together like the movements of a suite, sharing a single mood and a single palette, and the whole thing comes to a head with the concluding \u201cEdax,\u201d the most melodic song of the bunch, which builds to a dramatic climax of long held syllables and heart-in-mouth glissando.</p>\n<p>Shamloo\u2019s lyrics are cryptic by design, which only adds to the music\u2019s mystery; she describes her writing process as a kind of world-building exercise, sketching out elaborate narratives and characters and then boiling them down to a single salient detail. She favors assonant rhymes and slippery syntax, which makes the rare plainspoken phrases all the more powerful. \u201cMen burn the chariots down,\u201d she sings, mantra-like, in \u201cDen,\u201d before slipping into a speaking voice\u2014\u201cThe lake is frozen/The lake is frozen\u201d\u2014accompanied by charcoal-colored static and a dull, desolate whine. Whatever it might mean, it is absolutely gripping, immersive and surrealistic, cinema without sight.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Manchester's post-punk music scene in the early '80s had a rivetingly weird relationship to pop\u2014grasping at the mainstream with one hand, shoving it away with the other. A Certain Ratio started out as ascetic avant-gardists; their first single, 1979's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAM9uMKQCPw\">&quot;All Night Party&quot;</a>, was beatless and entirely un-party-like. Then they picked up the smashingly sharp funk drummer Donald Johnson, Jeremy Kerr got into slapping and popping his bass like he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1IuD6F3R5I\">Larry Graham</a>, and they started hanging out in New York City clubs\u2014the same sort of conversion to dance music that their scenemates and (Factory Records) labelmates New Order were undergoing at the time. In 1980 and 1981, ACR's singles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnqN-rGM3J8\">&quot;Do the Du&quot;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRVORzxxm5s\">&quot;Shack Up&quot;</a> were even getting played at some of those dance clubs.</p>\n<p>After singer Martha Tilson joined up to give trumpeter Simon Topping a break from his reluctant position as frontman, A Certain Ratio's six-piece lineup recorded and self-produced their third album, released at the beginning of 1982. Thirty-two years later, it still sounds like no other record: it's either that era's creepiest, boggiest dance album or its funkiest smear of brittle art-noise.</p>\n<p>One axis of the <em>Sextet</em>-era band is Tilson, who's as odd a vocalist as they could have picked. She's perpetually lagging behind the beat and beneath the pitches for which she's reaching, and she swallows her words, as if she's struggling to repeat them to herself. (Tilson's an acquired taste as a singer, but awfully distinctive.) Topping's one major turn on the mic here is similarly strange: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghHaN5KbOe4\">&quot;Skipscada&quot;</a>, a two-minute flurry of Brazilian percussion and trilling whistles, on which he scat-sings tunelessly, rolling his R's with infectious glee.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kerr and Johnson are doing their damnedest to play funk as hard as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybrRgAqiZ3c\">Sugar Hill Records house band</a>--hitting precise, clipped grooves while their bandmates run interference with haphazardly flung splashes of atonal piano and dissonant horn bleats. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihx87_WkVQg\">&quot;Gum&quot;</a> is produced like a good-time boogie track: Topping and Martin Moscrop's trumpets tootle out a soul-revue fanfare, Johnson and Kerr punctuate every few lines with get-down flourishes, and the whole band contributes to a samba breakdown. But everything's out of tune with everything else, and Tilson's distantly wailing &quot;I'm sorrreeee... I can't remember your name...&quot; If anyone was waiting for another &quot;Do the Du&quot;, they'd have to keep waiting.</p>\n<p>What they'd have been waiting for, actually, was <em>Sextet</em>'s centerpiece\u2014just not in this form. On the album, &quot;Knife Slits Water&quot; is a seven-and-a-half-minute, two-chord mantra: Kerr works endless variations on a little bass figure as Tilson mutters about sex, her voice doubled by an eerie pitch-displacement effect, and somebody makes a bunch of prickly noise with a kalimba. By the end of 1982, they'd re-record it as a single in the wake of Tilson's departure, and the terrific and even longer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP7fE6rZelo\">12-inch version</a> (included here), sung by Johnson, recasts the <em>Sextet</em> version's uncontrollable tremors as boogie fever.</p>\n<p>This new reissue appends a 13-track bonus disc to the original album. Besides the &quot;Knife&quot; 12-inch (and its B-side, a near-instrumental Sugar Hill pastiche with the Kabbalistic title <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIZfP2_wxu8\">&quot;Kether Hot Knives&quot;</a>), it includes the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNmQdgAM6BI\">&quot;Waterline&quot;</a> single that introduced Tilson when it immediately preceded <em>Sextet</em>, a couple of meandering dub experiments the band originally released under the name Sir Horatio, and BBC radio sessions from 1981 and 1982. They all illuminate the band's curious fascinations and tensions in that period, but <em>Sextet</em> itself\u2014a gorgeous mess, slumped against the back wall of the best dance club in town\u2014is no less mysterious for the illumination.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's been weird to see people try to puff up A Certain Ratio in the last few years, to make them more than they ever were during their lifetime. On the one hand, it's just a side effect of post-punk necrophilia; at some point, on or around August 2003, any remaining good (just good!) post-punk bands had finally been exhumed, renovated, rehabilitated, whatever. That's two years now of chasing up the lesser lights, dodgy one-shots, side-projects and general jerk-offery. C'mon-- those Brazilian p-punk comps are bad Cure demos with a tropical frosting.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know the <em>Early</em> comp came out in March 2002. Let's just say ACR was ahead of the crap curve. The facts remain: Simon Topping still sounds like Ian Curtis Cliff's Notes. The purported funkiness will still not be backing up any asses. Their name is just more lamentable Factory Nazi-chic. And there's very little ACR did that someone (Joy Division, the Cure, Liquid Liquid, Funkadelic, your mom) didn't do better. This is not to say they didn't have their charms. The double EP that contained &quot;Do The Du&quot;, &quot;The Fox&quot;, their (overrated but still pretty funny) cover of &quot;Shack Up&quot;, and &quot;Flight&quot; is good fun if you enjoy mooning with the blinds closed to twitchy approximations of forward momentum. (And hey, sometimes, who doesn't?)</p>\n<p>But when they started fucking with jazz, Latin, electro, disco-- check, pleez. This is not some sort of inverse pop-snobbery talking. This is a purely functionalist argument. By 1982, the disco tradition was just that: a tradition, one where all-night, non-stop dancing was the rule of law. Plenty of other cultures had been fucking with this for years, and it showed up in things like northern soul. Even when they tried to bodyrock, ACR were still hampered by their stiffness and leftover gloom. (Let's not even get into the inherent racism in the fallback &quot;but they had a black guy drumming for them!&quot; argument. Rhythm != drumming.)</p>\n<p><em>I'd Like To See You Again</em> was a swiftly recorded follow up to <em>Sextet</em> (the only ACR release of note after the early singles and half of <em>The Graveyard</em> and the Ballroom and even that's pushing its essentialness). Martha Tilson's proto-trip-hop vocals on <em>Sextet</em> were at least pleasing to the ear, if still essentially ballast, but here they're gone. So the band goes for longer grooves, more instrumental passages, and fewer vocals. I'd call it smart if the music were better. &quot;Touch&quot; acknowledges the new pop that ruled '82, but refuses to deal with it head on. &quot;Showcase&quot; has slap bass (<em>slap bass</em>). They throw party whistles and P-Funk backup chants on &quot;Saturn&quot;, and fair play, they're at least trying to have fun. But Martin Moscrop's trumpet, once the source of an amusing kind of fake electric-Miles fog (one thing they had that JD didn't), just sounds anodyne here. If you listen closely you can hear the beige Howard Jones records they would soon be making.</p>\n<p>A year later, of course, New Order released one of the biggest 12&quot; singles in history, tore up NYC clubs like the Funhouse, and permanently shook the Joy Division out of their hair. They even got to retain a slight creatures-of-the-night aftertaste that ACR were desperately distancing themselves from. All in all, ACR must have been pretty pissed off.</p>\n<p><em>Live 1980 was from a show recorded after their fateful trip to the U.S., where they recorded their debut album,</em> <em>To Each</em>, with Martin Hannett (which means it sounds exactly how you think it sounds) and had their wigs flipped by the hustle and bustle of early 80s NYC. And it shows, with a sound that has the tension between their sketchy raincoat beginnings and the good foot already breaking down. They're already straining to breath some of that American air, to suck up that mythical fonk, to banish the sooty taint of their homelands. Which pretty well killed them as a band. To make matters worse they avoid their hits in favor of album tracks, and then decide to do realt-time extended remixes, with lotsa percussion. The reissue includes two bonus tracks. If that excites you, check your pulse.</p>\n<p>All this is not to say I didn't enjoy parts, sometimes even large parts, of both records. But I can't imagine ever listening to them again. The problem with reissue culture, like real archaeology, is that eventually you're just hitting dirt. Sometimes an arrowhead is just a rock, you know? We all have finite time on this planet; do you want to listen to fake Funkadelic or the real thing? Ready your angry emails and dismissive blog posts if you must, but just think about it the next time your survey your gigs of mp3s, stacks of CD-R's, or mounds of .99 vinyl. How are <em>you</em> using <em>your</em> time?</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Rappers take the verse. Singers, whether live or sampled, take the chorus. That's the prevalent formula when combining hip-hop elements with other styles like rock or R&amp;B;, from most of the <em>Judgment Night</em> soundtrack to the Jay-Z/Link Park mashup to almost every Ashanti cameo. There are many ways to circumvent this reliance on dividing style by structural anchors, the most extreme-- and perhaps the most interesting-- of which is to disregard traditional song structures altogether. That's what a collective named A Gun Called Tension do on their self-titled debut, resulting in a highly organic blend of underground hip-hop and indie-rock elements.</p>\n<p>A Gun Called Tension consists primarily of two musicians: Bay Area rapper Sean Reveron, who collaborated with the Beta Band on their reinterpretation of Three Dog Night's &quot;One&quot;, and Dann Gallucci, one-time Murder City Devil guitarist and part-time Modest Mouse member. Each corrals a roster of guests: Roots Manuva, Airborne Audio, DJs Andy Sells and Monesa Yamakawa, Coady Willis and Spencer Moody of Murder City Devils, Blood Brother Morgan Henderson, Pretty Girls Make Graves singer Andrea Zollo, and producer Phil Ek.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, this project defines itself by tense outrage-- over political realities like the President's &quot;immaculate deception&quot; (&quot;5+1&quot;), and over lamentable music trends like the dominance of &quot;early 80s punk&quot; in indie music (&quot;Gold Fronts&quot;). While that dissatisfaction injects the lyrics with angry, restless energy, the real tension in the group's name comes from its music, which contrasts blaring rock rhythms with jumbled hip-hop beats and plays up the resultant friction on tracks like &quot;Treason&quot;, a punk shoutalong that sets Moody's guttural vocals against Gallucci's grinding guitar and Reveron's upbeat flow. While the rock rhythms inform Reveron's delivery, making his flow more singsongy, he remains cool and eerily imperturbable on the intense &quot;Thelonious&quot;, which beats like the heart of the album's bristling rage. Closing the album proper (before an acceptable &quot;Thelonious&quot; remix by Airborne Audio), &quot;Document&quot; unleashes that rage in an explosion of indie-rock momentum and urban/nocturnal atmosphere.</p>\n<p>But the album's high-point is a sung/spoken duet between Reveron and Zollo on &quot;Electric Chair&quot;, which has all the calm, swaying steadiness of a subway car, even as the uncertainties it documents threaten the singers' self-contemplation. Toward the end Zollo breaks off and sings wordless notes behind his vocals, and the effect is both bracing and haunting.</p>\n<p>&quot;Electric Chair&quot;, like so much of this sturdy album, works an understated contrast between calm and frantic, between ethereal and earthy, between confident and conflicted, between rock and rap. The album loses a little of its steam toward the end, when too many songs play up the rap side of the equation over the rock, but on the whole A Gun Called Tension is surprisingly balanced and beholden to no preconceptions of how these two styles should mix. Ultimately, the album cannot redefine these genres (what album could, especially without the benefit of time and hindsight?), but it does expand the possibilities of both, which is no small feat.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Received wisdom states that jungle brought about its own demise with its over-hasty coffee table gentrification (as symbolized by replacement genre name &quot;drum'n'bass&quot;), ushering in muso jazz and studio musicianship while draining the dancefloor energy that made the music vital in the first place. Of course, with drum'n'bass having spent more than a decade pounding &quot;dancefloor energy&quot; into an ideas-devoid mono-groove, it's worth examining whether the prior phase of decadent gentrification was really all its detractors claim it to be. Listening to Goldie's bloated 2xCD debut <em>Timeless</em> again, what irritates isn't the presence of noodling saxophones so much as the suspicion that Goldie thought it took a saxophone to make jungle epic. Orbital, with the clear vision sometimes gifted to outsiders, proved on their 1994 faux-jungle stab &quot;Are We Here?&quot; that the real possibility of the &quot;epic&quot; in jungle was hidden within the beat programming, offering up a broiling sea of slithering, snake-like drums.</p>\n<p>I like to think Orbital had been listening to A Guy Called Gerald (aka Gerald Simpson), who a year later released perhaps the only drum'n'bass album to successfully match gentrification with a consistent focus on &quot;rhythmic danger.&quot; It's this, together with the album's scarcity, that has long made <em>Black Secret Technology</em> a much-touted candidate for &quot;best jungle album ever.&quot; Previously, though, listeners had to imagine an ideal version of this music, squinting their ears to hear past the (diametrically flawed) murkiness or limp politeness of the mastering on the album's two prior releases. Thankfully, this new remaster of the original 1995 release achieves the best of both worlds, capturing the density of the original productions with a sharpness and force that was hitherto missing.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of <em>Black Secret Technology</em> was to break so radically with many of his peers' presumption of an inverse relationship between rhythmic complexity and musical sophistication. Blending in with the class of 95's aspirational mood-- albeit offering a more minimalist, Detroit-inspired take on it-- Gerald laces his productions with soft-centred synth pads, slightly moody soulful diva soundbites, precariously wafting flute samples, and eerie strings. But all this remains a foil for the unrepentant, rumbling boom of the bass-- and especially the beats. There is simply no other single-artist jungle album that pushes consciousness-altering beat programming as far, as fearlessly, as it is pushed here.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when it comes to rhythms this album is an embarrassment of riches. &quot;The Reno&quot; features cyborg drummers that seem to multiply before your eyes (or ears), the rhythm doubling over itself again and again while a diva cries &quot;eeeh yeah-eh-eh-eh,&quot; all swirling with a viscosity reminiscent of DJ Pierre's &quot;Wild Pitch&quot; house sound. On &quot;Survival&quot;, chattering time-stretched snares are progressively shattered into smaller and smaller pieces, until the groove resembles a fractured Cubist portrait of itself. On &quot;Dreaming of You&quot;, snippets of hand-percussion seem to rise and curl around your eardrums like steam. Most amazingly, the ravished and ravishing &quot;Cyberjazz&quot; is possessed with convulsive shudders, beats fluttering with a stop-start nervous intensity that evokes a myriad of electric synapses flickering on and off.</p>\n<p>Gerald's approach to rhythm is almost decadent at times: frequently, painstakingly assembled interlocking layers of beats are placed almost on the edge of conscious awareness, or otherwise punchy rhythms become swallowed up in tidal swells of infra-red bass. On gorgeous reggae-jungle single &quot;Finley's Rainbow&quot; the astonishing, counter-intuitive beats rain down with murderous fury somewhere far off in the distance; the effect is like watching a thunderstorm over a distant bay, with only brief moments of being lashed by the hail and the lightning. At times this can be slightly frustrating; at others I'm reminded of that strange combination of harmony and headwreck that krautrockers Can concocted on <em>Future Days</em> (ironically or fittingly, Gerald's greatest ever attempt to toughen up his mindboggling mid-nineties aesthetic remains his remix of Can's &quot;Tango Whiskeyman&quot;).</p>\n<p>Like Can, Gerald understood that the division between &quot;head music&quot; and &quot;body music&quot; is false and unnecessary: <em>Black Secret Technology</em> achieves its sense of hypnotic drift through panoramic rhythmic compulsion, supplying a frictionless endorphin high that only comes with a massive expense of physical energy. Gentrification? More like a very noble savagery.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>No one could seriously deny Gerald Simpson's contribution to electronic music. As a member of 808 State, he masterminded the first credible British responses to the techno being imported from Detroit. <em>Newbuild</em>, 808 State's debut, created the kind of catch-up energy that few albums have ever generated. I would even argue that it's dance music's <em>Nevermind</em>: it defined a whole new musical landscape and depicted, in huge sweeps, an entirely fresh mode of expression. The Roland 808, the TB303, and the other rudimentary machines and devices used to create <em>Newbuild</em> have all become fetish items of late, and were it not for Simpson's departure, 808 State would have become the pioneering electronic act without equal.</p>\n<p>But he did leave, and has done pretty well for himself since. He wrote the warehouse anthem &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; before realizing that the voodoo within the tune was blighting him. He turned his attention away from thrashing Derrick May at his own game and took to the polyrhythmic expanses of jungle. Released on his own Juicebox label, <em>28 Gun Bad Boy</em> and <em>Black Science Technology</em> prove that when focused, Simpson is capable of disciplined soulful electronic masterworks.</p>\n<p><em>Essence</em>, however, showcases his distracted, settle-for-almost-anyone self-- the one that gets record companies interested and involved. The last time he let a company control him, they refused to release the album (<em>High Life Low Profile</em>, nixed by Sony). Before that, the company had messed around with <em>Automannik</em> and left a meager husk of a reportedly vee vee special record. Studio !K7 release <em>Essence</em> probably with a heap of reverence in their hearts, and that's why they can't tell him that Lady Miss Kier doesn't belong on a cigar-lounge trip-hop album that criminally disguises its avant-jungle artistry. They apparently also can't bring themselves to tell Simpson that <em>Essence</em> actually deserves rejection.</p>\n<p>Geffen once sued Neil Young for producing un-Neil Young albums. And while I appreciate that artists must have the freedom in which to break down boundaries and public perceptions, I do feel that record companies should tell revered and honored artists when they're producing sub-standard stuff. And infuriatingly sub-standard <em>Essence</em> is.</p>\n<p>The dead giveaway is the opener, &quot;The Universe,&quot; an awkwardly delivered spoken word piece about the universe within our bodies and the spirituality that we house in the micro-universes of our atomic make-up. This undisciplined, unsubstantiated new age clap-trap would be far more at home in the coffeehouses of UC Berkeley than they are on <em>Essence</em>. &quot;Could You Understand&quot; strives for the emotional power of &quot;Finley's Rainbow,&quot; Black Science Technology's crucial reworking of Finley Quaye's version of Bob Marley's &quot;Sun is Shining,&quot; which also borrows from Jacob Miller's multiply versioned &quot;Baby, I Love You So.&quot; Lamb's Louise Rhodes, potentially the most compatible collaborator, gives a sterling performance of the psychobabble &quot;Humanity,&quot; which is as galling a session of fatuous ego-stroking self-actualization as anyone might hear outside of an anger-management seminar conducted by a lapsed and self-loathing cleric.</p>\n<p>Sad to relate, there are plenty more lyrics gleaned from Borders' Self-Improvement Section. On &quot;Universal Spirit,&quot; Wendy Page trills, &quot;Universal spirit elevates your soul/ When your heart perceives it/ Love is in control/ Dive into the ocean/ Energize your love.&quot; At least when former Deee-Liter Lady Miss Kier steps up to the mic, she's downright strange: &quot;Something's really happening/ Smoking sassafras/ Grass is on her arse/ Wearing out her slippers.&quot; No one can withhold the Adam Ant Award for Utter Whibble from Lady Miss Kier for such baffling cobblers!</p>\n<p>Throughout <em>Essence</em>, Simpson valiantly attempts to compensate for his vocalists' inadequacies. The music he sets their Aquarius-Age warblings to is invariably some of the most sincere and artful that a drum-n-bass producer has ever committed to hard disk. Even the Bukem-ish &quot;First Breath&quot; remains unimpeachable due to the accurate and faultless position of each beat and sub-bass boom. &quot;Humanity,&quot; lyrics aside, initially shuffles in a samba before Simpson's heavily echoed toms prepare us for the subtle rush of his processed breakbeats.</p>\n<p>&quot;Final Call&quot; revisits rave's undeniable glories-- from the Cabaret Voltaire basslines to the Pet Shop Boys orchestral stabs, and the jack track hand claps and rimshots. The track is unashamedly nostalgic, but since Simpson pretty much invented the style, it'd be churlish to reprimand him for it. If &quot;Fever or a Flame&quot; were versioned (sans Wendy Page), it would doubtless reside in junglist DJs boxes for months; cleansed of insipid vocals, the track would be an unstoppable peaktime roller.</p>\n<p>What makes <em>Essence</em> such a gadfly is that, had Mono or Hooverphonic released it, I'd have been thrilled that they'd escaped from the Serge Gainsbourg-sampling, goatee-stroking gulag they wandered into quite voluntarily. But as <em>Black Science Technology</em> unquestionably proved, a Guy Called Gerald is matchless in his ability to create faultless techno soul.</p>\n<p><em>Essence</em> mocks its creator's reputation. I can hear elements of an outstanding, possibly even genre-opening album amongst the jumble of guest vocals and conventional verse/chorus/verse structures. It's as though Simpson needs more than to create another soulful masterpiece of machine music; he needs the fleeting pleasure of being a one-hit wonder. If Simpson is mad keen on collaborating, why not hook up with Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello, an artist who would be equally soulful and more than capable of understanding and complimenting his exemplary machine-soul aesthetic. Until then, we must either use a mental filter to erase the inanities, or return <em>Black Science Technology</em> to the disc tray and wait for another five years to pass before Simpson releases another comeback.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The debut album by New York producer Mark Hurst, aka A Pleasure, was made using &quot;a process of numerical transposition&quot; to turn the names of some of his favorite composers and groups into drum patterns. This may sound like the sort of high-concept postmodern hook that only a brainiac seeking to liberate dance music from the oppression of the dance floor would employ. But <em>Jream House</em>\u00a0doesn't sound like that at all; it turns out to be a euphoric trip that doesn\u2019t shy away from more direct types of gratification.</p>\n<p>The name of the opener,\u00a0&quot;Durutti Gottsching,&quot; suggests that the beat was possibly generated from the names of the British post-punk band <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/\">the Durutti Column</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/\">Ash Ra Tempel</a> leader Manuel G\u00f6ttsching. It follows the conventions of Detroit techno, down to the cavernous reverb on the handclaps, except for the way that the hi hat, synthesizer arpeggios, and bassline abandon its straight 4/4 time signature in favor of interlocking complex rhythms. This might sound overcomplicated, but it's kept grounded by an extremely funky bassline\u2014a busy, warm-toned lead that nods at the more organic-sounding end of the krautrock spectrum.</p>\n<p><em>J**ream House</em>\u00a0shifts from\u00a0&quot;Durutti Gottsching&quot;\u2019s jubilant funk to the otherworldly house of\u00a0&quot;Arthur Russel&quot;\u00a0(another track that does justice to its namesake), to the densely composed, deeply blissed-out flurry of noise on\u00a0&quot;The Order of Things,&quot;\u00a0a track that might make you wonder why\u00a0&quot;Balearic shoegaze&quot;\u00a0isn\u2019t a genre already.\u00a0&quot;Grace&quot;\u00a0uses cascading, jazzlike breakbeats to ride\u00a0&quot;The Order of Things&quot;\u2019s energy close to the edge of sensory overload.</p>\n<p>After that cacophonous peak, Hurst lets the album drift gently back to Earth, through clouds of Balearic mood. (&quot;Slow Channel&quot;\u00a0sounds like it was made to watch the sun rise to, with waves of atonal metallic sound washing over it.) By the time\u00a0&quot;Am Me Evol Eye&quot;\u00a0drifts off into ambience, the album\u2019s energy has returned to the same near-resting state that the intro to\u00a0&quot;Durutti Gottsching&quot;\u00a0opens it with, giving <em>Jream House</em> an elegant overall symmetry, not to mention a subtle but powerful hypnotic effect. For someone so interested in playing conceptual name games, Hurst\u2019s choice of pseudonyms, like the most gratifying aspects of <em>Jream House</em>, is surprisingly straightforward.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>\u201cMaking a song from alpha to omega is challenging,\u201d <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/\">A-Trak</a> told Forbes last November. \u201cIt's from a song that has already worked in some capacity. You're taking a piece of something that is already catchy at in some way and you are decorating it with your production.\u201d Perceiving the art of the remix as mere decoration might be anathema for its finest practitioners\u2014be they Fran\u00e7ois K., <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/\">Ricardo Villalobos</a>, or Puff\u2014 but in \u201900s dance culture, A-Trak\u2019s work and sensibilities served as an amped-up gateway for a new generation. Whether they checked his Soundcloud because of his connection to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/\">Kanye</a>, because they loved southern hip-hop but not <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6877-ed-banger/\">Ed Banger</a> (or vice versa), or because of festival-friendly remixes of big indie rock acts, A-Trak\u2019s work ethic blurred genre lines.</p>\n<p>Culling a decade of remixes (with over 180 remix credits to his name), the lavish <em>In the Loop</em> 6x7\u201d box set marks the first time that many of these digital-only remixes have been available in a physical format rather than Beatport-only download. The opening remix of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/212-architecture-in-helsinki/\">Architecture in Helsinki</a>\u2019s \u201cHeart It Races\u201d (back when A-Trak still used the handle Trizzy) showed that from the start A-Trak had a knack for tearing down the mid-\u201900s\u00a0walls between indie rock, mainstream hip-hop and electronic dance music. He takes <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/\">Neptunes</a>-type drum stutters, adds hip-hop backspins, a touch of steel pan and keeps the noxious yip of vocals intact, yet it all winds up sticking together.</p>\n<p>Listening to all these remixes at once reveals that A-Trak often tried to please everyone, and his knack for picking over\u00a0myriad genres often meant\u00a0he felt the need to shoehorn everything in with each remix opportunity. His remix of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4915-scanners/\">Scanners</a>\u2019 \u201cBombs\u201d is the equivalent of a dogpile: compressed rock guitar stabs, multiple sped-up vocal samples saying \u201cdrop,\u201d rave synth swoops, voices minced until they become hiccups and then\u2014why the hell not?\u2014some cowbell dumped on for good measure, as if to make sure every box gets ticked.</p>\n<p>His remix of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4187-sebastien-tellier/\">S\u00e9bastian Tellier</a>\u2019s \u201cKilometer\u201d seems similarly intent on touching on every trend in French dance music. A-Trak filters the kick down to a muffled throb redolent of \u201cAround the World,\u201d before bringing in a swell of disco symphonic strings and electro squelch, ranging from Ed Banger filter house to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/\">Daft Punk</a> then back to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois disco. Similar sensibilities get applied to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/\">Phoenix</a>\u2019s \u201cTrying to Be Cool\u201d as he builds the opening keyboard figure into something bombastic. Visit a section of the song that doesn't have Thomas Mars\u2019 telltale voice and one would be hard-pressed to distinguish it from any other track of the past decade.</p>\n<p>What A-Trak delivers in spades is big, simple\u00a0pleasures. For <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8269-boys-noize/\">Boys Noize</a>\u2019s \u201cOh!,\u201d he devastates with little more than that titular shout, vocodered growls, dancehall sirens and a feverish beat. He wasn\u2019t the first one to have a go at the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/\">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> late-period dance move of \u201cHeads Will Roll,\u201d but his remix is undeniable. Jacking up <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6484-nick-zinner/\">Nick Zinner</a>\u2019s tepid goth synth stabs until it\u2019s brawny enough to fill a Coachella tent, he cuts away the band\u2019s ineffective rock moves and instead replaces it all with leaner electronic components. A-Trak remakes <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6468-karen-o/\">Karen O</a> into an icy electro queen, surrounding her with only the finest <em>fromage</em>: lasers, claps, 303 squelches and gaudy builds.</p>\n<p>Give him the keys to another Brooklyn dancepunk band though\u2014in this instance <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/\">the Rapture</a>\u2014 and the same tricks don\u2019t pan out. On the piano-house-meets-gospel glory of \u201cHow Deep is Your Love,\u201d A-Trak doesn't have the patience to give the song time to unfurl, shortening the song by a third, getting right to the dramatic build and then adding heaps of neon and rave lights. For the remarkable range of artists that <em>In the Loop</em> displays, A-Trak\u2019s ability to mash together different genres and sounds into a crowd-pleasing amalgam also means that\u2014much like a great night out\u2014the distinguishing characteristics blur together into an undifferentiated mass.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Alain Macklovitch is a young dude with a musical career that already spans a decade and a half and has gone through several distinct phases. He started out as a baby-faced turntablist savant who won the most prestigious DJ competition in the world before he could legally drive a car. After that came the <em>Sunglasses Is a Must</em> era, where he left the insular world of turntablism for a gig as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/\">Kanye's</a> tour DJ, and to figure out how to incorporate his hip-hop-derived skills into the emergent post-indie dance music culture. We are now well into phase three, where he established himself as a legitimate EDM heavyweight with at least one certified rave anthem (<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/40207-video-duck-sauce-barbra-streisand/\">&quot;Barbra Streisand&quot;</a>, which he recorded with Armand Van Helden under the name <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28340-duck-sauce/\">Duck Sauce</a>) under his belt, as well as an eye for talent that's made Fool's Gold, the label he runs with the DJ/producer <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7639-nick-catchdubs/\">Nick Catchdubs</a>, one of the most influential indies in the music business.</p>\n<p>Phase-three <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/\">A-Trak</a> is not only the most successful of his incarnations but also by far the funnest. The turntablist scene he came up in has a marked tendency to emphasize technical chops over pleasure, but over the years he's evolved into a full-on hedonist who's not afraid to skirt the line of what some might call cheesiness, and has fully embraced the place in arena-filling quasi-mainstream EDM culture that &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; helped earn him.</p>\n<p>After years of near-constant gigging in nearly every shape and size of venue imaginable, Macklovitch has developed a very clear idea of what qualities a song needs to move a crowd, and his new four-song EP is definitely intended to put that knowledge to work producing yet another signature track capable of making tens of thousands of people lose their shit at the same time.</p>\n<p>It's possible that either &quot;Jumbo&quot; or &quot;Disco Nap&quot; could end up being that track. The former, produced with the Swedish EDM supergroup Galantis, has a frenetic, 90s-cyberpunk feel, and enough tweaky rhythmic breakdowns to appeal to an audience predisposed to dubstep. The latter, a collaboration with LA DJ duo Oliver, offers a popping electro-funk groove, acid-house-style buildups, and a vocal hook that pays tribute to the popular and highly recommended practice of getting a nap in before going clubbing.</p>\n<p>But odds are it'll be either &quot;Tuna Melt&quot; or &quot;Landline&quot; that becomes the kind of inescapable song that\u2019ll show up in every set of a multiple-DJ bill without anyone in the crowd complaining. Both are precisely engineered to move bodies, to the point where it almost feels manipulative and unfair, as if you barely have a choice in the matter. Aspiring dance music producers should consider drawing out diagrams for their structures to learn where to add sounds, where to take them away, when to switch the tone of the synth playing the lead melody, and other essential qualities that a rave anthem needs.</p>\n<p>&quot;Landline&quot;, a collaboration with production duo\u00a0GTA, has several lessons to impart, including how one can manipulate a retro sound like a booming 90s-style synth piano using modern ideas such as the glitchy clusters of notes popular with trap music producers, or where to shift the gears on the tempo from half-time to double-time (and where to shift back), as well as the potential of a ridiculous sample (in this case of Woody Woodpecker's laugh) to push a song well over the edge of sanity.</p>\n<p>&quot;Tuna Melt&quot; is as immaculately and meticulously crafted as one of his DMC-winning turntablism sets. There isn't a superfluous sound in its nearly six minute span, nothing-- from the stunningly simple but inescapable main riff to the chopped-up, diva-style female vocal sample-- that doesn't have a clear role in motivating the listener to dance. It has the ruthlessly efficient grace of an <em>Alien</em> xenomorph, and it doesn't require any chemical assistance to move an EDM fan to a place of total rave bliss. I suspect Macklovich won't have to write another arena-sized anthem for at least a few more years.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This could be Internet-accelerated nostalgia talking, but A-Trak's first <em>Dirty South Dance</em> mix keeps sounding better the further 2007 disappears into the rearview. Bringing Southern bounce back to its bass roots by mashing it up with European electro-house? Somehow A-Trak made it work, mostly through sheer force of mixing skills and some surprisingly compatible beat selections. Going back to it now to hear &quot;Walk It Out&quot; or &quot;Hustlin'&quot; over the hyperactive snarl and throb of post-Ed Banger club music transcends its genre-stunt origins, creating a snapshot of club rap's tentative late-2000s forays into a thugged-out hip-house revival.</p>\n<p>A sequel might have less to worry about as far as justifying its concept, but more on its shoulders when it comes to living up to a great predecessor. <em>Dirty South Dance 2</em> gets a bit more focused in the process: Unlike the anything-goes, geographically-shaky definition of &quot;Dirty South&quot; displayed on the first mix, <em>DSD2</em> leans heavily on the current front line of Southern hitmakers, the post-Soulja Boy/Gucci contingent sharing time with vets like Young Jeezy and Birdman. (And Consequence, who's from Queens, but OK.) That grounds it a bit deeper in a specific regional tradition-- nobody's rapping in French on this one-- but still lets a host of stylistically distinct backing tracks shift momentum and mood.</p>\n<p>When it clicks, it brings new dimensions out of both tracks in the mix. The singsong cadence of Roscoe Dash's &quot;All the Way Turnt Up&quot; sounds even more Pixy Stix giddy when it's fitted to the hiccup of Claude Von Stroke's &quot;Vocal Chords&quot;. Laying Dorrough's &quot;Ice Cream Paint Job&quot; over The Ones' cartoon-80s electro track &quot;Blast&quot; turns a 20-mile-an-hour boulevard cruise into a high-speed trip around the Nurburgring, but it heightens the original vocal's cockiness. And say what you will about Soulja Boy as an MC, but it makes a lot of sense to transplant his simplistic dance-rap into a subtle-as-a-pile-driver house track like the Martin Brothers' &quot;Dum&quot;.</p>\n<p>Those moments all work [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| because A-Trak's not content to merely let the acapellas and the instrumentals meet each other halfway--\u00a0 the best segments of the beats are isolated, ramped up, and deftly cut for ideal momentum, while the vocals are stitched into the mix so precisely you'd think they were originally spit over a house beat. That does make the awkward matchups stick out more. &quot;Vampires Going Ham&quot; is the most egregious example: replacing Grade A Muzik's brilliant Def Jam '86-gone-ATL beat is a tall order, and using DJ Touch\u00e9's horror-prog &quot;Vampires&quot; necessitates that Pill's flow be chopped up and spread out until all the urgency and punch is completely drained from it. And no matter how hard you try, you just can't make Ludacris sound at home over an old-school piano house track.</p>\n<p>Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained; at least the majority of <em>Dirty South Dance 2</em> is enough to make you feel like there's still some life in this franchise yet. (And A-Trak released this mix on his site for free, meaning you get a hell of a lot more than you pay for.) Still, there are a couple signs of restlessness here. A-Trak drops the mash-up conceit for a couple of exclusive tracks-- Carte Blanche's Kid Sister collaboration &quot;Do! Do! Do!&quot; and DJ Craze's remix of Donnis' &quot;Gone&quot;-- both of which are excellent but feel more like intermissions than continuations of the mix. And then there's the last track, which pulls out a sudden, final left-turn away from the electro-house vibe: that's Yung L.A.'s &quot;Ain't I&quot; over Joker's euphoric wobble-bass colossus &quot;Tron&quot;, and its arm-swinging lope annihilates everything in the previous 43 minutes. A <em>Dirty South Dance 3</em> might still be enjoyable, but A-Trak's practically guaranteed that <em>Dirty House Dub</em> would be a monster.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>How much does a good mix need to do? If you stop and think about it, there doesn't seem to be a very complicated agenda behind the best ones: keep the rhythmic momentum consistent, shift the tone or mood at the right moment for emphasis, transition between tracks in a non-disruptive way, and cover enough stylistic ground to avoid tedium without going too far and coming across as a disjointed, genre-hopping traffic jam. It's music designed for moving, and if the people are moving, then technically it works. But there's a difference between going to hear someone DJ at a club and actually investing in a mix CD: in the latter case, there's that extra burden of permanence, of knowing that someone will pull this off their shelf or their hard drive years from now as a snapshot of a moment in sound.</p>\n<p><em>Infinity +1</em> says something in that respect: if you want an hour's worth of what constitutes the midpoint between popular and underground dance music at the end of this decade, call A-Trak. Between his Kanye West cred, his facility with a wide spectrum of club music subgenres, his recent history of quality releases like <em>Dirty South Dance,</em> and his just-out entry into the FabricLive series, he's established himself as a favorite among the shutter-shades generation, and for good reason. He's great at putting familiar styles into interesting contexts, blurring lines between eras, and just plain knowing what tracks sound good next to each other. <em>Infinity +1</em> is an enjoyable exhibition of those skills, even if it's not particularly outlandish in its celebration of modern (and a little classic) electro and house.</p>\n<p>The mix isn't without its personality, of course: It opens with Shel Silverstein reading his poem\u00a0&quot;Invitation&quot;\u00a0(&quot;If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar/ A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer/ If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire&quot;), then segues into John Dahlb\u00e4ck's chirpy, upbeat\u00a0&quot;Sidewalk&quot;\u00a0with accompaniment by an astronomy-documentary voiceover relaying the life cycle of a maturing star. Not like this is A-Trak's big grown-up artistic statement, though, even if he does pay respect to his elders via Lifelike's electro-fied remix of Farley\u00a0&quot;Jackmaster&quot;\u00a0Funk's 1986 house classic\u00a0&quot;Love Can't Turn Around&quot;\u00a0and Alexander Robotnick's\u00a083 Italo cult smash\u00a0&quot;Problemes d'Amour&quot;. For the most part, it's a succession of names you might've seen if you keep up with the right labels, or at least the MP3 blog discodust: Holy Ghost! (&quot;Hold On&quot;), DJ Mehdi (&quot;Pocket Piano&quot;), Little Boots (&quot;Stuck on Repeat&quot;, remixed by Fake Blood)-- and, a few times, A-Trak himself, both as remixer (S\u00e9bastien Tellier's\u00a0&quot;Kilometer&quot;; MSTRKRFT's N.O.R.E.-featuring\u00a0&quot;Bounce&quot;) and remixee (DJ Spinna reworking his deathless\u00a0&quot;Say Whoa&quot;).</p>\n<p>Yet as familiar as these tracks might be to scenesters, they're even more familiar to A-Trak--\u00a0he knows their ins and outs so deeply he has the exact knowledge of where they most effectively overlap. The beatmatching on <em>Infinity +1</em> is immaculate, hiding the seams so well that he creates brief pockets of mash-up serendipity: The new-wave dance rock bassline of Midnight Juggernauts' &quot;Shadows&quot;\u00a0dovetails neatly into the stuttering vocal intro to the Boys Noize remix of Gonzales'\u00a0&quot;Working Together&quot;, and K.I.M.'s burbling synthpop-meets-Detroit techno throwback\u00a0&quot;Party Machini&quot;\u00a0gets snuck up on by Laurent Wolf's\u00a0&quot;The Crow&quot;\u00a0to create a monster tandem bassline. And even though the overall tenor of the mix might be familiar, club-friendly electrohouse, A-Trak shows his range by flavoring it with modern hip-house crossover (&quot;Bounce&quot;; Donnis'B-more-meets-ATL\u00a0&quot;Party Works&quot;; new Kid Sister track\u00a0&quot;Life on TV&quot;) and concluding it with the pastoral, acoustic guitar-driven Prins Thomas remix of James Yuill's\u00a0&quot;This Sweet Love&quot;. There's been better mixes this year-- A-Trak's own <em>Fabriclive.45</em> amongst them-- but if you want to stick evidence of life in early 2009 into a time capsule for exhuming a decade later, <em>Infinity +1</em> will put this era in a positive light.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Comb through A-Trak's bio and a portrait of preternatural technical skill, sly business acumen, and uncommon idealism emerges. He won the DMC World DJ Championships in 1997, at the age of 15, and he would go on to DJ for Kanye West at the height of his fame. He turned down an opportunity to DJ for Jay-Z <em>on principle</em>, out of loyalty to Kanye (although he would agree to handle musical direction for Hova's tour-- having cake, meet eating cake).</p>\n<p>Nike's been pretty shrewd in selecting timely, suitable artists for its <em>Nike+ Original Run</em> series, which features continuous mixes designed for exercise, so it's not surprising that they've turned to A-Trak for their latest. Nor is it surprising that his contribution to the series features the same steel-wheel virtuosity, slippery micro-cuts, acrobatic beat shuffling, and block-party swagger that made his <em>Dirty South Dance</em> LP such a blast.</p>\n<p>What is mildly surprising is that A-Trak regards this as his debut album (he says so twice on the Fool's Gold label website) rather than a one-off thing, which creates some unreasonable expectations for it. A lifestyle accessory with corporately mandated demands (Nike, quite sensibly, dictates the structure and pace of mixes in the series to conform to the physiology of a runner) can't be the kind of balls-out creative manifesto we want from a long-awaited debut.</p>\n<p>A-Trak's mix essentially includes five distinct movements. After a calling-card warm-up, the beat drops and we get into &quot;Say Woah&quot;, where a fat, fuzzy caterpillar of a bass line, needling funk guitars, and a hype man's call-and-response get our blood pumping. It ramps up fast: When A-Trak starts slicing up the vocal sample after a brief edit, it's like we've gone straight from mild stretches to full-tilt step aerobics. As the discrete elements of &quot;Say Woah&quot; get spliced and juggled with typical dexterity, the pinging Euro techno of the second movement washes in and gets syncopated with squelchy flecks, bass grenades, rubbery rumble-strip synths, and 808 claps.</p>\n<p>The third section is\u00a0a slinky, mid-tempo cool-down, with\u00a0gusts of noir-ish synthetic strings and serviceable club-rap by Fool's Gold artist Kid Cudi (there's a leaked snippet with Lupe Fiasco on the track, but apparently Lupe couldn't be cleared, which perhaps explains why a guy you've probably never heard of says he misses the days when he could walk around in public). Movement four is total choogle, with A-Trak grinding hard on strobe-light synth sequences and revved up splashes of countermelody, and five brings us to an arpeggio-happy finish line. If this sounds all over the place, it kind of is. Maybe it's weird that A-Trak's original productions feel less cohesive than his cuts of other records-- we'll have to wait for an unmediated LP before we can say for sure whether this scattershot feeling is intrinsic to his original work or specific to this project.</p>\n<p>As far as the whole running thing goes: I ventured out into this hundred-degree summer to give it a shot. It worked fine until the tense yet kinda sluggish Kid Cudi section-- I tried running in slow motion, but it's hard, and the neighbors look at you with pity. So\u00a0instead of finishing, I had\u00a0a nice wheat beer with lemon on the porch. I'd like to blame A-Trak, Kid Cudi, Nike-- anyone but myself-- for my truncated run, but that would be unfair, like getting pissed off at MF Doom when you listen to his music and discover you still can't shoot lasers out of your eyes.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>At their worst, mash-ups can come across as patronizing in-jokes, elbowing your sternum at how totally way-out crazy it is that two pieces of music from disparate genres can actually coexist in the same space. The lazier bootleg artists stick to a predictable formula: Look for the most incongruous styles you can beatmatch, give the resulting track a cringeworthy portmanteau of a title (&quot;Smells Like [insert Britney Spears reference here]&quot;), and jam that culture for all it's worth. Maybe that's why mash-ups fell out of favor after their <em>Boom Selection</em>-fueled circa-2002 heyday: The idea worked a lot better when it wasn't the three-minute, 192 kbps version of a rimshot.</p>\n<p>There's reason enough to assume that <em>Dirty South Dance</em> is a similarly ironic venture: regardless of how seriously you take boutique propagandist Shepard &quot;Obey&quot; Fairey, his &quot;Easter Bunny bling&quot; cover design screams forced whimsy, and the mix's idea to combine last year's crunk and comparatively obscure electro-house theoretically smacks of hipster goonery. (If the name &quot;Tha Pumpsta&quot; hasn't yet dislodged itself from your memory banks and forced some bile into your throat, I'll give you a minute.) The (stereo)typical audience for this type of thing tends to skew towards the superficially trendy, and the first minutes of the mix-- Lil Jon yelling over gleeful, chirpy Euro-scuzz electro-- might elicit either baffled amusement or embarrassed revulsion, depending on how tired you are of club kids screwing around with crunk.</p>\n<p>But if A-Trak is prone to a certain level of aesthetic smartassery, he's no charlatan. In the decade since he won the 1997 DMC World DJ Championship at a prodigious 15 years of age, he's turned the art of turntablism back toward its original party-rocking focus-- the dude can scratch and beat-juggle, but he's just as skilled at maintaining momentum and crafting seamless segues. And while listeners might look at <em>Dirty South Dance</em> on paper and formulate some sort of genre hierarchy-driven classism in its blueprint, the mix works simply because it largely pretends that line doesn't exist. (And considering how Tag Team's &quot;Whoomp! (There It Is)&quot; turned Kano's 1980 Italo-disco track &quot;I'm Ready&quot; into one of the first nationally massive Southern bounce hits, it's not that much of a stretch.)</p>\n<p>Most of the blends are effective to the point of essentially supplanting the original tenor of the instrumental portions, and while A-Trak tends to tweak the rap a cappellas in order to better fit the rhythms, the best ones still feel like dance on the Dirty South's terms. The cartoon ghettotech Peanut Butter Wolf mix of Baron Zen's &quot;Turn Around&quot;-- one of the more stilted moments on Stones Throw's <em>Chrome Children</em> comp-- sounds a lot more natural with Da Backwudz' unruly &quot;I Don't Like the Look of It (Oompa)&quot; laid over it. And Rick Ross' &quot;Hustlin'&quot; is fused to Simian Mobile Disco's &quot;Hustler&quot;-- a matchup obvious enough that Cadence Weapon attempted it sometime last year, though A-Trak's take (titled, yeah, &quot;Hustlin' Hustler&quot;) does more to trim the empty spaces from Ross' vocal and heightens the velocity of the SMD original. The result is that each beat of its amped-up electro rhythm turns into a foil for Ross' deceptively-calm voice to ricochet off.</p>\n<p>But while most of the cuts tend to lean a bit more heavily towards the rhythms of the indie-dance set and modify the vocals accordingly, they hardly detract from the MCs' original qualities. Yung Joc's &quot;It's Goin' Down&quot;'s is stretched out over the throbbing raver punk of Soulwax &quot;E-Talking (Nite Version)&quot;, his cadence drawn out to a relaxed drawl that makes his declaration &quot;err'body loves me/ I'm so <em>fly</em>&quot; sound twice as smooth as the original. Rich Boy's &quot;Throw Some D's&quot; is turned into a halting but forceful hip-house vocal to match Para One's remix of Daft Punk's &quot;Prime Time of Your Life&quot;. And Clipse's &quot;Wamp Wamp&quot; is scattered frenetically across Alex Gopher's retro-electro &quot;Motorcycle&quot;, their tempo (and the Neptunes' lingering steel drum hook) ratcheted up to Bambaataa velocity. (One aside: A-Trak, who got his first turntable as a bar mitzvah gift, noticeably omits Malice's &quot;It cools to a tight wad/ The Pyrex is Jewish&quot; verse.)</p>\n<p><em>Dirty South Dance</em> isn't an entirely accurate title, though, and there's a decent-sized glut of international debris that breaks the theme. And aside from the Pack's Bay Area anthem &quot;At the Club&quot;-- with its glassy-eyed &quot;in the club, I shake my ass/ At the party, I shake my ass&quot; chorus sounding enough like a stereotypical deadpan electroclash chanteuse to feel right at home alongside Cassius' &quot;Feeling for You&quot;-- most of them push the mix out of focus. Gwen Stefani's dippy &quot;disco Tetris&quot; dud &quot;Yummy&quot; clashes against the disco Katamari Damacy of LCD Soundsystem's &quot;Time to Get Away&quot;, French rappers TTC sneeringly sing-song their way through &quot;Quitte La Piste&quot; (which, to its benefit, features a synth hook that sounds like a Ducati exhaust hooked up to a pipe organ), and the mandated-by-law appearance from M.I.A. has her muttering &quot;XR2&quot; over a Giorgio Moroder track-- which sounds all right, but why should she be the one get all the <em>Scarface</em> quotes?</p>\n<p>As if there was still any question that this techno shit belongs anywhere near hip-hop, A-Trak ends his mix with a good Q.E.D.-- naturally, it's Timbaland's beat for &quot;My Love&quot;, which he lets fly at its own familiar pace for a moment before frantically juggling it and eventually cranking it up as fast as it'll go, transforming it into a dizzying explosion of breakbeat hardcore that sounds like the Prodigy circa 91. It's one of the most berserk codas you'll ever hear in a dance mix, but A-Trak knows well enough to bring that beat back down to its original pitch before switching the lights off. He may have just spent the last 50 minutes pairing off some unlikely artists, but he's too busy moving the crowd to smirk at the results.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If emo and New York fashion rock are as ideologically opposed as red and blue states-- weepy strings vs. buzzsaw guitars, maudlin lyrics vs. cynical ones, introspective sensitivity vs. extroverted cool-- then A.R.E. Weapons' sophomore LP attempts to be a bridge between the two. The band haven't abandoned the nihilistic front on which they made their name: tinny bounce beats ripe for a Jeezy or Weezy ad-lib still fart away under sewer-rock guitars, although this time around they've added a human drummer for a more credible thump. And Brain McPeck's smarmy vocals are still peppered with aggressively superficial lyrics that seem like tacit rebukes to anyone who's ever felt anything-- the throbbing dirge &quot;Doghouse&quot; is an ode to unfounded self-satisfaction; the Suicide-lite creep-out &quot;Push 'Em Back&quot; revolves frivolously around that time-honored cheer; the 8-bit pulse of &quot;Who Rules the Wasteland?&quot; continues to conflate NY nightlife with a weird Mad Maxian vision of post-apocalyptic turf wars.</p>\n<p>The music is better this time around-- the guitars cut harder and deeper, and occasional Rapturous harmonies glam up McPeck's unctuous sneer. But more interesting is how throughout the record, a kinder, gentler (or at least more conflicted about being privileged and shallow) A.R.E. Weapons asserts itself, and despite the hokey context of these glints of humanity, they scan as weirdly sincere. On a serious note, I won't speculate as to whether or not the death of their original guitar player made them take a long, hard look at their essentially cheap take on existence, except to throw it out there as a possibility. On an unserious one, maybe seeing his sister in <em>The Brown Bunny</em> shook something loose in Paul Sevigny's soul, something that rippled out through the band at large. Or maybe it's just another layer of irony, although there are no cues to indicate anything of the sort. I can't call it. Maybe someone just fell in love.</p>\n<p>The record opens with &quot;These Tears&quot;, where, over a nervous plink and crashing guitars, McPeck begins with his usual snottiness: &quot;All my life you know I've been so cold/ I never shed a tear.&quot; It's surprising when the bluster suddenly turns to insecurity-- &quot;Dear God what is wrong with me?/ Am I really this dead inside?&quot;-- and even more so when the insecurity turns into bald-faced empathy. McPeck cries for &quot;the days that [his] heart was black,&quot; for &quot;the people [he] threw away,&quot; for &quot;the crimes of history,&quot; for &quot;people feeling all alone.&quot; Has he actually realized that being poor and disenfranchised isn't very funny? This isn't an isolated incident; time and again the mask of alienation slips to reveal a human being who believes that &quot;everybody needs somebody&quot; (on &quot;F.K.F.&quot;) and that &quot;We fuck up sometimes but in the end we know what to do/ We take each other hand in hand/ Walk off into the night&quot; (on &quot;Into the Night&quot;). Just so we're clear, this is still extremely bombastic, ridiculous music, and if you're one of the many people who walked out halfway through Electric 6, you probably don't want to bother checking out Electric 7. But by comparison, A.R.E. Weapons is practically elegant, and if their newfound sensitivity is a put-on, it's at least a convincing one.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In the whiskey wake of last year's <em>Donkey Stock</em> EP, British quintet Absentee extend their louche Silver Jews twang and lush 1960s pop shuffle to <em>Schmotime</em>, a debut album of deceptively vulnerable songs about banging, boozing, and the weird bootleg chemistry of the whole boy/girl/bed gestalt. Beerlight punk'd baritone Dan Michaelson undermines his macho-ironist pose with subtle sissydom which, along with sharp tunes and still sharper wit, creates a tension that makes <em>Schmotime</em> more than just another indie-country-rock moper.</p>\n<p>Absentee would gladly let you believe that Michaelson's a Hemingway-grade misogynist asshole, down to un-British drunken drawl. &quot;Will you be there/ If I leave her for you?&quot; he ponders on opener &quot;More Troubles&quot;, gutted by guitarist Babak Ganjei's barbed Malkmusisms. But drummer Jon Chandler kicks in with the &quot;Be My Baby&quot; beat, horns waft woozy with Spectorian grandeur, and all of a sudden the dude's hair might as well be emo-cut. Michaelson fronts even bigger on &quot;We Should Never Have Children&quot;-- &quot;Some people never should have met,&quot; he explains-- but kids actually sing in the background, so haha. Riotous single &quot;Something to Bang&quot; scores the chicks out of 10 and gets an 8 for sloppy effort. &quot;I'm an animal/ And you're an animal, too,&quot; Michaelson cunningly reminds on &quot;Weasel&quot;.</p>\n<p>Imagine peeling off David Berman's beard and finding Stuart fey Murdoch. If feelings are taken as weakness signs, that's just another reason men drink, but Michaelson's got a surprisingly decent bead on his feminine side. &quot;I'm tired of being a man,&quot; Michaelson admits moments before ogling some boobage. Feminine sidewoman Melinda Bronstein edges off his macho bluster with graceful backing vocals, as if the girl-group rhythms weren't enough. &quot;You Try Sober&quot; tries on Loretta Lynn's nightie (don't come home a-drinkin', hon), while &quot;Duck Train&quot; finds Michaelson imploring, &quot;You're the only one I want.&quot; By closer &quot;Treacle&quot; Absentee are waxing silly on the infinite sweetness of love, but check the title.</p>\n<p>Much of <em>Schmotime</em> reenacts one of the oldest farces in the mating game: the sensitive man's misguided attempts to come off dickhead to get women. In the meantime, the buoyant brass and plaintive pop shine through the cigarette-cloud bar-howdy, even if the arrangements occasionally melt together in the haze, and &quot;Truth is Stranger Than Fishin'&quot; is as tenuous as it sounds. Dark humor gets through his deep-down scared-shitlessness; on the remarkable &quot;There's a Body in a Car Somewhere&quot;, he imagines the police taking samples of his dead lover's teeth and hair. Unsure whether to laugh or cry, Michaelson wonders: &quot;Is it not enough to have lived and to have loved?&quot; I'll get back to you on that.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Elegant debauchery is a tough thing to nail, and there are only a few bands who have managed to strike that perfect balance of class and crass and make music that transcends both. Tindersticks, for example, have been cranking out albums that freely migrate from posh lobbies to stained sheets, desire to addiction. On their debut EP, Absentee seem to be flirting with this same territory (right down to the donkey in the title), though not with quite the same success.</p>\n<p>Most of the music rests in this ambiguous place between country indie rock-- eighth notes on the bass caressed by steel guitar and Daniel Michaelson's molasses baritone. An occasional stab of distortion-soaked guitar breaks the record's focus on slow, brooding ballads. So to does the sole up-tempo track, &quot;Something to Bang&quot;, which is stuffed with fuzzy leads and pounding drums offset by Michaelson's steadfastly low-key vocals, which join the song at more of a walking pace and scarcely rise above a tone of casual conversation. &quot;I'm tired of being a man/ Always something to bang,&quot; he says, but his discomfort with his own desire in the lyrics isn't fully fleshed out.</p>\n<p>Later, on &quot;In the Toilets Again&quot;, he sings &quot;It doesn't help to know we're having sex without coming&quot; and it feels similarly, er, unfulfilled, as though the imagery of the song is hoping for the debased depths of the human spirit, but can't get past the &quot;doo doo doo doo&quot; backing vocals to find it. That the dirtiness in the lyrics feels frequently contrived is a major strike against the effectiveness of the record as a whole. Otherwise, things work nicely, as the band has a good sense of dynamics, and Michaelson's voice inhabits their countrified textures with heavy world-weariness.</p>\n<p>So all the pieces aren't yet fitting together as they should, but Absentee are still a winning proposition on the whole. This is just a debut EP, 26 minutes long, and one gets the impression that this is a band that will sound more at home in the longer format of an album, where ideas can be drawn out and mistakes are more easily overlooked.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Despite being the butt of many a joke during its salad days, the &quot;bad thriller&quot; has become a topic of serious scholarly debate. Dissertations and books have been devoted to the potential feministic undertones of movies like <em>Halloween</em> and <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. Carol Clover's <em>Men, Women and Chainsaws</em> (1993)-- one of the premiere works on the subject-- posited the notion of a so-called Final Girl in slashers as a bastion of feminine righteousness. According to Clover, while all the other tramps are getting hacked during or following a casual sexual encounter, Final Girl abstains from illicit behavior, and ultimately avoids death. Our heroine is cloistered, bookish, and androgynous-- in short, a shameless feminist stereotype.</p>\n<p>But well-intentioned or not, slasher films are often crass and inelegant-- and, as the adage goes, it's not what you say; it's how you say it. Fortunately, <em>Bad Thriller</em>-- the third album from French synth-hop daemons Abstrackt Keal Agram-- possesses more urbanity and verve than almost anything in the slasher canon. One thing <em>Bad Thriller</em> shares with its namesake film genre is a homespun, low-budget aesthetic. And the three-note acoustic guitar arpeggio and conjoining synth melody at the beginning of its title track sound hauntingly like a prelude to a gory murder-- but that's where the similarities end.</p>\n<p>While Abstrackt Keal Agram's previous full-length, <em>Cluster Ville</em>, dwelt in dour monotony, <em>Bad Thriller</em> is a sufficiently more upbeat affair, featuring a handful of radiant melodies (case in point: M83's remix of AKA's song titled for Grandaddy's frontman, &quot;Jason Lytle&quot;). And while songs like &quot;Street Lamp Confessions (Ghost Version)&quot; and &quot;Yo, Rap!&quot; affirm Abstrackt Keal Agram's penchant for angular beats and turntable stylings, the group's addition of fragile acoustic guitars to their craggy synthscapes, adoption of a more diverse approach to songwriting, and tendency to sing (in often hushed vocals) as often as they rap make this album more well-rounded than its predecessor. &quot;Delta Force&quot;, in particular, shows the sophistication and hopefulness missing from <em>Cluster Ville</em>: After a gloomy, disjointed opening section-- over which guest vocalist Poor Boy slurs double-tracked vocals like, &quot;When you wake up, you feel so tired/ Destroyed by the rules of time&quot;-- the song performs a sly turnabout with gorgeous synth glides augmenting a subtly mutating guitar harmony. This song, like most of the LP's others, features discernable parts and complex evolutions, rather than just cascading instrumentation atop a stagnant rhythmic loop.</p>\n<p><em>Bad Thriller</em>'s liner notes feature Abstrackt Keal Agram's name graffiti'd on a trucker hat, but their music is a novel reconciliation of old-school beatmaking and modern synth-pop in refulgent 32-bit color. Although the album packs an overwhelming number of ideas into a scant 36 minutes-- and occasionally feels thematically and stylistically disjointed-- Abstrackt Keal Agram have vastly improved upon their prior outings. And the fact that these songs were all written and recorded late last year-- immediately following the release of <em>Cluster Ville</em>-- means the improvements came quickly. In my Pitchfork review of <em>Cluster Ville</em>, I tagged Abstrackt Keal Agram &quot;the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques roster.&quot; Here, their undying enthusiasm has served them well-- and every indication is that they'll only get better.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's been more than a year, but the Western Hemisphere has finally caught up with burgeoning French electronic label Gooom Disques. M83, Cyann &amp; Ben, Mils, and Abstrackt Keal Agram comprise the white-hot nucleus of the imprint (and, for that matter, the French electronic scene, at least as far as we &lt;&gt; can ascertain). If Europe has traditionally housed small, prolific pockets of groundbreaking electronic artists, Gooom is the DFA of the labels that sponsor them, sporting an upstart roster of innovative acts and an impressive cache of mixtapes to prove it. Abstrackt Keal Agram are the most hip-hop-oriented of the crop, as witnessed by frequent collaborations with rap duo Atoms Family and a pesky jones for remixing, which resulted in last year's sensational transmogrification of M83's &quot;Run into Flowers&quot;. Unfortunately, <em>Cluster Ville</em>, the Morlaix, France duo's sophomore album, lags somewhat behind their proven remix skills.</p>\n<p>The album kicks off on a sterling note with a trio of songs that run neck-and-neck with the bulk of the Gooom repertoire. &quot;Del&quot;, the incendiary opener, chugs for four minutes on a determined beat while weaving a firm tapestry of no-frills synthesizers. The compositional style recalls nothing so much as instrumental rock bands like Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, whose songs incorporate a static foundation on which they can perform instrumental variations, forcing the listener to experience every subtlety in order to gain a full appreciation of the music. &quot;Pi\u00e8ce&quot; continues in this fashion, as a similar beat drives a gently pulsating array of synthesizers. Meanwhile, a Rhodes piano scatters spare, repetitive dabs of color, suggesting Prefuse 73's sci-fi beatmaking. The aptly titled &quot;Brouillard&quot; is a scatterbrained montage of orchestral swells, parsed beats, and hissing found sound. Coupled with spare, monastic murmuring and an austere synth melody, the song sounds like a Hitchcock mystery overture from the 22nd century.</p>\n<p>Those three inaugural tracks, however, constitute the effervescent summit of <em>Cluster Ville</em>, which means it's gently but steadily downhill from there. When the haze clears, the listener is left with the inexplicable &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, a dull, mechanical rap that features clunky verses, drooled in the Queen's best English, from Cryptic and Alaska of the Atoms Family. The French stylings of James Delleck and La Caution on &quot;L'oreille Droite&quot;, <em>Cluster Ville</em>'s only other vocal track, are a slightly smoother and more interesting, mainly due to their foreign novelty. Other songs, named for such great minds as &quot;Nietzsche&quot; and Grandaddy's &quot;Jason Lytle&quot;, show promise early on, but are quickly smothered by lachrymose monotony and epic length.</p>\n<p><em>Cluster Ville</em> is distinctively hip-hop in flavor, more indebted to Josh Davis and Scott Herren than to other musique electronique artists such as M83 or Air. At times, though, the group seems equally enamored of the American hip-hop aesthetic as they are of its sound. The aforementioned &quot;Mata Hari&quot; is littered with irreverent, tough-talking emcee samples and references to, among other things, <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, Elton Brand, and naturally, guns, and while there's nothing wrong with these subjects, the song lacks a context to substantiate their usage. The overwrought solemnity of certain songs is another hindrance. Without the much-needed contrast of sunnier moments, &quot;A.C.,&quot; &quot;Audio Crash&quot; and &quot;Petersbourg&quot;, which form the middle section of the album, turn languorous, plodding onward like cogs in Maxime Gorky's factory. Too often, the duo seem to force emotional gravity upon their songs through a reliance on minor key drones and near-industrial beats. The effect is enervating.</p>\n<p>Abstrackt Keal Agram are the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques roster. They posses the enthusiasm and the talent to create good work, but <em>Cluster Ville</em> lacks the consistency, urbanity, and introspectiveness of recent albums by M83 and Mils. Whereas their labelmates have assimilated technology into their songwriting styles to the point that it's become as elemental as acoustic instrumentation, Abstrackt Keal Agram still seem unduly fascinated by it. If they can trim their eagerness, and lend the same verve to their original songs as they do to their remixes, Gooom might have another winner on their hands. And if they can't, well, the label could still employ them as the resident house mashers.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>As a student at SUNY Purchase, Adrian \u201cAce\u201d Mojica had the chance to work with <a href=\"http://philmoffa.com/\">Phil Moffa</a>, a producer of gritty techno who holds office hours and teaches classes on mastering techniques. Even though AceMo has been making music for a while (as a member of the New York club-music collective Swim Team, and with a duo of cassettes for Brooklyn\u2019s Bootleg Tapes), Moffa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2847\">hands-on, hardware-centric approach</a> catalyzed an evolution in AceMo\u2019s live techno to a dusty, wheezing beast, now realized more than ever on the visceral, dystopian <em>Black Populous</em>.</p>\n<p>Before the first note of <em>Black Populous</em> hits, there\u2019s a brief sound of hissing tape. This fuzzy electrical undercurrent runs through the album out of practical necessity. Armed with decades-old drum machines, synths, samplers, and a four-track cassette deck, AceMo forgoes the sharp-edged, chrome-plated possibilities of manipulating and arranging sounds on a computer for a more kinetic and expressive approach to making beats: sessions captured straight to tape, without edits or overdubs. This approach continues in the recent tradition of the New York underground: punk-techno from outlets like <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s\">L.I.E.S.</a>, the dusty, muffled house of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/terekke\">Terekke</a>, or the low-slung moods of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/jiovanni-nadal\">J. Albert</a>. Call it \u201clo-fi,\u201d but it\u2019s the grimy byproduct of the city\u2019s incessant throb\u2014the take-no-prisoner beats reflect the necessity of hustling to make ends meet in a place as unforgiving as New York. Make noise with the tools you\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>Mojica\u2019s relentless energy bares its teeth on the grinding, eight-minute \u201cHip Hop Hoax,\u201d and mid-album cut \u201cX Train.\u201d Both tracks are experiments in noise-wrangling, as feedback stretches and squeals into slimey motifs that sound freshly scraped from sewage pipes. The raw energy in \u201cHip Hop Hoax\u201d is a guttural scream, anchored by a booming 808-style bass drum, trying to break out of its box. The punishing beat pumps through the overloaded mix, and the track sounds at its best with the volume cranked all the way up, as loud as Ace had it running in his studio when he cut the track. \u201cX Train\u201d zips along at almost 140 bpm, effectively simulating an elevated Brooklyn subway car running an express route, the cabin shakes side-to-side while wheels screech and passengers barrel forward.</p>\n<p>Opening track \u201cAcid Pact\u201d features Detroit producer <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/2lanes\">2Lanes</a> alongside Mojica as they dig into an electrical field of sputtering breaks and distant synths. \u201cAcid Pact\u201d feels more situated in the context of a whirlwind LSD trip than the 303/909 acid techno its name implies. Across seven minutes, fluttering synths and a commanding kick drum shift in and out of focus in a kaleidoscopic arrangement. It\u2019s one of the deeper, less abrasive moments on the album, where softer edges feel like momentary comforts compared to the harsh environments these tracks reflect.</p>\n<p>The final two cuts, \u201cBlack Populous\u201d and \u201cTime 2 Change (Regular Ass Chord)\u201d dive even further into comforting corners. The title track\u2019s gently bobbing melody recalls <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31467-huerco-s/\">Huerco S.</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/personofinterest\">Person of Interest</a>, while rapid-fire, iambic kick drums feel like a heartbeat on the verge of attack. At nine minutes, album closer \u201cTime To Change\u201d offers little variation, while a gorgeous chord anchors the slowly building beat in a blunted haze\u2014a gentle coda to a particularly biting, near-80-minute album.</p>\n<p><em>Black Populous</em>\u2019 energy is only hampered by its length, with most tracks stretching upwards of six minutes. But the idea of a \u201cblack populous\u201d has universal implications for AceMo, and the album doesn\u2019t need to be digested all at once. Accompanying the release, Mojica writes: \u201cBlack is the color of endearment. Black is of pain, black is of freedom, black is cold, black is warm, black populous is whatever you, want it to be.\u201d Even further, <em>Black Populous</em> is the thrum of New York, and in it, AceMo thrives.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Several regional dance music scenes feed into the work of Darren Cunningham, aka <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/\">Actress</a>. His singular, ever-evolving breed of experimental techno has precedents in Detroit, Chicago, and his native London, though none of these cities explain Cunningham. Rather, his music\u2014which has grown conceptually weighty over his past few releases\u2014imagines and perhaps even conjures another place, a new home for itself. In Kodwo Eshun\u2019s *More Brilliant Than the Sun, *a collection of essays considering electronic music through an Afrofuturist lens, he writes \u201cEverywhere, the \u2018street\u2019 is considered the ground and guarantee of all reality, a compulsory logic explaining all Black Music, conveniently mishearing antisocial surrealism as social realism.\u201d The phrase \u201cantisocial surrealism\u201d is an excellent term for the broadly-drawn but inward-leaning world Actress creates.</p>\n<p>On his last full-length, 2014\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18946-actress-ghettoville/\">Ghettoville</a></em>, the place conjured was dusty and post-apocalyptic; the songs were intensely evocative, but also dragged under heavy bad-signal fuzz. That album\u2019s press materials led many to believe it was Cunningham\u2019s last release as Actress, but with <em>AZD</em>, he returns, though his persona has evolved. Its first single \u201cX22RME\u201d stoked hope that Cunningham might return to the project\u2019s less abrasive, more club-oriented early sound, but it\u2019s for the best that <em>AZD</em> (its title, pronounced \u201cazid,\u201d an anagram for Cunningham\u2019s childhood nickname Daz) forges ahead on its intensely contemporary path.</p>\n<p>While *AZD *moves between modes and styles, reaching deep into both Cunningham\u2019s clubbiest and most avant-garde impulses, it maintains a clarity of vision. With the fuzz of *Ghettoville *dialed back a bit, the tracks\u2019 skeletal structures come into relief: it\u2019s generally easy to hear the distinct components of each and to meditate on the album\u2019s \u00a0juxtapositions. Actress\u2019 plaintive music-box melodies and shuffling beats can loop unchanging for a pop song\u2019s length. \u201cUNTITLED 7\u201d combines a tense synthesized-string passage with a sticky ascending bassline; halfway through, the strings are traded for hi-hats, a small change that relocates the track entirely. \u201cFANTASYNTH\u201d loops a liquid melody over the crunchy pulse of a beat, with some tinny, whirling sounds moving between.</p>\n<p>The late New York artist and musician Rammellzee, sampled in \u201cCYN,\u201d looms over <em>AZD</em>. And his language-building (or language-deconstructing) projects seem a particularly useful point of reference. Rammellzee\u2019s \u201cGothic Futurism\u201d manifesto drew a link between medieval monks and graffiti artists, positing the latter as regaining some multi-dimensional power in the Roman alphabet that, he thought, had been previously quashed by the development of Western culture. Though Cunningham uses words sparingly, mostly in partially-lodged samples, he\u2019s also concerned with the limiting and liberatory possibilities of language. If we think of the structure of a song as itself a vernacular language\u2014guiding us, in the case of dance music, through the builds and drops of a track\u2014Cunningham then develops his own forms, sinking us deep into a soundscape through relentless repetition, and overlaying that space with alternate ideas so that we\u2019re stretched in a few directions at once.</p>\n<p>Cunningham\u2019s structures also disintegrate, and those moments of collapse are key. One of <em>AZD</em>\u2019s stated themes is chrome, that highly reflective plating that has intense black-and-white contrasts. Little about this album is aesthetically crisp. Cunningham\u2019s deliberate use of hiss gives the lovely impression that parts of these tracks are playing through an old car stereo\u2014and, more broadly, contributes a sense of space outside of the neutral confines of the club. But when tracks come undone, it\u2019s precipitated by metallic elements breaking apart. \u201cDANCING IN THE SMOKE\u201d maintains a churning pace, a sampled voice instructing or observing: \u201cDance, hear my record spin.\u201d As another vocal sample interjects to repeat the phrase \u201cthe future,\u201d sharp atonal accents pierce through aimlessly. This leads into \u201cFAURE IN CHROME,\u201d which came out of his collaboration with the London Contemporary Orchestra earlier this year. Passages from Romantic composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRequiem\u201d are interlaid with glitchy squeals, which erode the melancholic tones to reveal new frequencies below.</p>\n<p>But for all its artfully-deployed discordance, *AZD *maintains a musicality that holds the listener close. Sometimes this comes through in more danceable techno moments, like the single \u201cX22RME\u201d or the 80s-leaning synth-driven track \u201cRUNNER,\u201d; elsewhere, it\u2019s in the \u00a0emotive minimalist breaks of \u201cFALLING RIZLAS\u201d or \u201cTHERE'S AN ANGEL IN THE SHOWER.\u201d Cunningham participates in a futurist tradition, following an arc set by artists and writers like Rammellzee and Eshun. But that futurism isn\u2019t predictive, something yet to come; rather, his combination of science fictions, music histories, and socio-spatial realities feels deliriously adjacent to the world we\u2019re listening to it in.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>After nearly a decade of cryptic transmissions, Darren Cunningham, aka <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/\">Actress</a>, is packing it in. He's doing this both professionally\u2014alluding to the &quot;conclusion of the Actress image&quot; as well as retirement\u2014and artistically. <em>Ghettoville</em>, his fourth album, is a scorched hard drive, a dour drone record that takes his fascinations\u2014Detroit techno, Chicago ghetto house, rap\u2014and repeatedly kicks them in the ribs. This was a calculated move. The album arrived with a press release that sounded roughly like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT_lFIdN6qk\">Sarah Connor's opening monologue</a> from <em>Terminator 2</em>: &quot;The machines have turned to stone, data reads like an obituary to its user.&quot; After three slew-footing albums that played Jenga with established genre rules, <em>Ghettoville</em> is content to wallow in the ruins of the musics its predecessors so fascinatingly deconstructed.</p>\n<p>It's difficult to tell how much of Cunningham's end-times blather is bullshit. He's a savvy marketer\u2014he famously referred to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/\"><em>Splazsh</em></a> as &quot;R&amp;B concr\u00e8te&quot;\u2014and way funnier than his high-art-golden-boy reputation would lead you to believe. (A <a href=\"http://www.thebeatjuice.com/read/2014/01/07/4174/actress-q-and-a/\">recent interview</a> describes Cunningham as lifting up &quot;a hefty glass of cognac and look[ing] through it at the flames&quot;; let no one accuse this man of not knowing exactly what he's doing.) But if Cunningham is bluffing, the opener &quot;Forgiven&quot; is one hell of a poker face. Seven minutes of plodding, gray loops, &quot;Forgiven&quot; refuses to pick its feet off the ground, pouting like a child protesting bedtime by moving as slowly as possible. Lacking any hidden alleys or tricky variations, the track ensures that anyone who hears the remainder of <em>Ghettoville</em> <em>really</em> wants to hear it.</p>\n<p><em>Ghettoville</em>'s\u00a0darker, nastier tone is its defining trait, but the album's lack of dynamism is what's truly alarming. Never before has Cunningham built his tracks out of so few ideas, and never before have those ideas seemed so barefaced and plain. The lumpen funk bassline of &quot;Rims&quot; recalls Excepter's more staid moments. &quot;Towers&quot;, featuring a slow, pulsing kick drum and a single, distorted tone played on-beat, is simple and inelegant. &quot;Time&quot; plays like a parody of experimental music: six minutes\u2014and it feels like double that\u2014of wintry stasis interrupted by a flat, lifeless voice repeating the track title. It's probably a joke, the type of musical prank Cunningham has laced his albums with in the past, but it's one performed at our expense.</p>\n<p><em>Ghettoville</em> frustrates most when Cunningham offers the type of transfixing delights he's known for. &quot;Birdcage&quot; is a taut piece that allows a flute-like melody to worm in and out of a baffling rhythmic stew. &quot;Gaze&quot; proves Cunningham hasn't lost touch with the dance floor, as a sweet, light synth pad ushers along a grimy piano riff and a pattering house rhythm. The deranged mumble that passes for a melody on &quot;Contagious&quot; is the one thing sickly enough to justify Cunningham's rhetoric. The spectacular closer &quot;Rule&quot; dices MC chatter into an undeniable earworm and places it on a bed of grubby organ chords; it stands as Cunningham's finest and most complete reworking of hip-hop.</p>\n<p>Cunningham's work has always offered a crucial interactive component, giving listeners the opportunity to unpack the origins of his musical baubles. If you failed, or just weren't up for it, you were still left with something pleasantly cryptic. <em>Ghettoville</em>'s leaden, idle tracks reject this interaction, so you're forced to take Cunningham at his word: <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9310-actress/\">we live in a brittle, addicted world</a>, and this is what a brittle, addicted world sounds like. <em>Ghettoville</em> is a lecture, at least inasmuch as a largely beatless, voiceless work can be. Self-contained,\u00a0<em>Ghettoville</em> refuses to commune with anything but itself, including the broken and disadvantaged world it purports to represent. Cunningham's perplexing persona has always been overshadowed by his ability to confound us with his records; <em>Ghettoville</em>, disappointingly, shifts that balance.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>I never met an <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/\">Actress</a> track I didn't immediately love until the first time I heard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjFvsOUws68\">&quot;Voodoo Posse Chronic Illusion&quot;</a>. Londoner Darren Cunningham has been on an astounding run since his debut, 2008 LP <em>Hazyville</em>, but he's never been an easy artist. His abstracted techno tends to appear opaque, yet somehow retains its transparency by revealing layers upon layers of sound hidden in the crushed frequencies. You have to look for it at first, but even with his most difficult music, somehow you know there's genius lurking underneath. With the <em>Silver Cloud</em> EP, however, I wondered for the first time whether some of his magical, digital dust was missing.</p>\n<p>Of course, I was wrong. Which I figured out after about 10 listens. But there is something that feels different about the <em>Silver Cloud</em> EP, his first new music since 2012's\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16544-actress-rip/\">R.I.P.</a>.</em> That record had a strangely homemade and organic feel to it, like finger-painting with pixels. While <em>Silver Cloud</em> uses the same palette of rainy-day greyscale crackle, the three-track EP sees a return of sorts to beat-oriented material, following\u00a0<em>R.I.P.</em>'s pastoral landscapes. It also marks a homecoming to Cunningham's own <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WerkDiscs\">Werk Discs</a> label, having spend time over at Honest Jon's.</p>\n<p>The EP starts off with &quot;Voodoo Posse Chronic Illusion&quot;, one of Actress' longest tracks to date. Its palette is plaintive, but the way it methodically, mindlessly repeats <em>forever</em> with little variation is almost aggressive-- like a particularly hostile staring contest. This dimension feels less friendly than usual, maybe even lazy. But lay on the lapping ebb and you'll be pulled into deep relaxation with every mangled guitar strum; it's lo-fi new age music. You'll hardly even notice the brittle percussion come in and nudge everything along so beautifully and fluidly.</p>\n<p>The flipside is even stranger. Much of the talk surrounding the EP-- which was pressed as a sneaky white label before its proper digital release-- was flustered frustration about whether the vinyl rips floating around online were at the correct speed. It's easy to understand the confusion: these two tracks are syrupy slow, mining the same dungeon house territory as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/\">Andy Stott</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/\">recent work</a>, all demonic vocal samples and engine room churn.</p>\n<p>Both tracks are cut from the same cloth, but different in mission. &quot;Silver Cloud Dream Come True&quot; is illusory, industrial techno beat thin like malleable metal, marking each bar with a portentous chime. &quot;Floating in Ecstasy&quot;, meanwhile, is unlike much else in the Cunningham catalog: It's drenched in tape hiss, and the synth noises have more in common with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/\">Wolf Eyes</a> than anything else. Here he's taking a rare cue from someone else, the lo-fi house of collectives like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17507-lies-presents-american-noise/\">L.I.E.S.</a>. It's a move that already suits Cunningham's distinctly decayed, sawn-off palette. Like all three tracks on <em>Silver Cloud</em>, it's unusual and a little more impenetrable than usual. But like Cunningham's entire oeuvre, each track unwinds into a tapestry of intense sonic detail if you just give it a little time to recline.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Darren Cunningham is one of those dance music producers who has spent most of his career moving away from the dancefloor. The\u00a0London-based\u00a0artist's\u00a0first two albums as Actress, 2008's <em>Hazyville</em> and 2010's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/\"><em>Splazsh</em></a>,\u00a0sounded like mid-1980s house and techno collaged together and played on a radio from under the freeway. Half of his newest, <em>R.I.P.</em>, doesn't even have beats. Listening to him discuss his process making it-- which included reading John Milton, philosophizing about death, and smoking weed-- you'd think he was a PhD candidate.</p>\n<p>&quot;I want to make cool, classical stuff for a modern generation,&quot; he said in a <a href=\"http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-actress.html\">recent interview</a>. The phrase &quot;classical stuff&quot; alone will probably disqualify him from the academy. Good. It's not where he belongs. Like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, what makes Cunningham special is that he's an artist capable of referencing extroverted, populist music like house and rap in order to create a meditative, introverted experience.</p>\n<p>In general, his productions are less about their build-and-release than their atmosphere, which hovers over the bones of the music like some sick gas cloud. The innovation on <em>R.I.P.</em> is to put as much effort into making things clean as making them dirty, and the result is a sense of contrast: Fog gives way to clarity; fat, puffy synthesizer sounds play off pinprick-sharp ones. Like all good contrasts, it's simple and eureka-like: By bringing the acidic sounds to the surface and keeping the air-conditioner hum somewhere in the depths, Cunningham takes the monolithic sound of his earlier productions and breaks them into layers-- compared to <em>Splazsh</em>, it's practically prismatic.</p>\n<p>It's not the sound that makes the music, though, but the structure of it. <em>R.I.P.</em> is a deliberately uncoordinated album. Rhythms, basslines, and melodies slip in and out of line with each other. Comparatively straightforward, house-oriented tracks like &quot;Shadow From Tartarus&quot; are situated next to murk and ambience like &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot;. The emphasis here, though, is on &quot;comparative&quot;: Even R.I.P.'s steady 4/4 tracks sound grimy and deconstructed. But there's something almost flirtatious in the way he lets the sounds worm around in the dark, looking to hook up with something firm. When they do, it's both mechanical and mystical, like watching a sculpture cut from raw stone.</p>\n<p>The thick crud over Cunningham's earlier albums mimicked a sense of loss and erosion, as though he'd found the music abandoned in an alleyway and brought it back to something resembling life. The disparate sounds on <em>R.I.P</em> don't need resuscitation, just room to breathe. Given that room, they arrange themselves. If the album\u00a0could be called intimate, it's paradoxically because there's so much distance and disconnect to it. Listening to it can be like seeing the city you live in from a plane: You can't reach out and touch it but you're comforted by how manageable and well-planned it all looks.</p>\n<p>Cunningham's scope is already wider than producers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/\">Burial</a> or <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/\">Zomby</a>, who tend to keep dance music's vocabulary intact, even at their most abstract. When <em>Splazsh</em> first started going around,\u00a0Cunningham\u00a0called it &quot;R&amp;B concrete,&quot; which, as marketing speak, was terrific, but as self-description was mostly aspirational. On <em>R.I.P.</em>, the blending between the traditions of techno and the traditions of ambient and minimalist music are more apparent. Until he comes up with something better (or it ends up being used for a soda campaign), &quot;cool, classical stuff for a modern generation&quot; will have to work. As for his shift in focus, he confesses to not getting quite as stoned as he used to. The fresh air has done him good.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>One of the upshots of dance music's active compartmentalization-- into genres and subgenres and niches aligned with certain kinds of basslines or BPM-- is the exalted space it affords work that jams the system. If an album proves unique, we celebrate it. And then that album makes us think all the more scrupulously about the system it happened to jam.\u00a0Actress's <em>Splazsh</em> is one of those albums. Actress-- a DJ/producer from London named Darren Cunningham-- slots into a recognizable realm of artists working in the wake of dubstep. But little, if anything, in his sound shares much with dubstep as it's most often understood. His bass isn't very big, his snares don't crack in isolation, his atmospheres don't heave in the air of cavernous negative-space.</p>\n<p>So what's the link? A certain formal seriousness and rigor-- a sense of tracks transpiring the way they do for reasons owing to some kind of project, whatever that project (probably rhythmic and arcane) may be.\u00a0But such talk downplays the many visceral thrills of\u00a0<em>Splazsh</em>. Even the subtle stuff has an immediate effect: By the end of its sneakily weird eight minutes, opener &quot;Hubble&quot; has gently pushed the album into a sort of spinning motion that speeds up and slows down, but never quite stops. The slow-motion speed lets Actress throw in an array of sounds he'll sort through in time: woozy ambient waves, dry drums, crazy lasers, a slow synth arpeggio that sounds lifted from some old grainy sci-fi movie.</p>\n<p>And so <em>Splazsh</em> keeps spinning, even as it moves through floaty dreamscapes strewn with sighs and chimes (&quot;Lost&quot;) and austere breakbeat abstractions (&quot;Get Ohn [Fairlight Mix]&quot;). There's almost nothing that ties such disparate tracks together, except for\u00a0<em>everything</em>. And that <em>everything</em> owes to the simultaneous sense of adventure and control that has made Actress one of the most intriguing electronic-music makers at work today.</p>\n<p>Actress himself has called his music &quot;R&amp;B concr\u00e8te,&quot; and that helps illuminate the way he works from both inside and outside a track. He has an ear for building up a song from the bottom (like a pop producer) and then abstracting it from the top (like a <em>musique concr\u00e8te</em> technician), so that he makes some incredibly strange sounds surprisingly palatable-- and without making a big show of their strangeness. In that, Actress shares a certain allegiance with post-dubstep artists like Zomby (who has made records for the label that Actress runs, Werk Discs). But there's a range of hooks and ideas at play in <em>Splazsh</em> that few others have approached, much less made coherent.</p>\n",

The latter was especially appealing for its balance of ambient techno and pop, and it brought together disparate artists like Tracey Thorn and DJ Koze in a way that felt natural and fun. You could recommend it to somebody without much interest in minimal techno and be pretty confident they'd dig it. So it's reasonable to anticipate good things from Ada's latest, <em>Meine Zarten Pfoten</em>, but the album defies expectations to the point that it's actually kind of puzzling.</p>\n<p>Rather than embrace her techno past or more fully flesh out <em>Adaptation</em>'s mixed-genre approach, what Ada does here is go almost completely soft pop. Like, &quot;Girl From Ipanema&quot; soft pop. Now, I think there's a kernel of a good idea here, maybe something building out from Saint Etienne's elegant travelogue music, but what we get feels tamer than that. Songs like opener &quot;Faith&quot; are so airy and peaceful that they seem flat, and there's generally a weird avoidance of beats. It's hard to imagine &quot;Likely&quot;-- composed mainly of acoustic guitar strumming and chintzy organ-- being worse off with some force behind it.</p>\n<p>If that sounds harsh, it's because I think Ada is capable of stronger material, and she shows that during the record's second half. Here, the pillowy folk vibe that occurs throughout much of\u00a0<em>Meine Zarten Pfoten</em> (which tellingly translates to &quot;my tender paws&quot;) breaks up some to reveal tracks that are more dynamic and tightly constructed. You've got stuff like &quot;At the Gate&quot;, patient deep house that builds to a hypnotic climax, and &quot;Intro&quot; (strangely not the first song), which is rich ambient techno that showcases Ada's gifts for texture and slow burn. The thing about these highlights, though, is that they're quite separate from the rest of the LP-- different enough in tone and style that they almost don't fit. Together with the ultra-mellow atmosphere, this lack of cohesion makes the album feel messy, and maybe worse, a little boring.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The dance-album-as-single-artist-mix is such a good idea, addressing so many of the attention-straining problems that plague dance music full-lengths, that you have to wonder why more producers don't make use of it. Several of the best dance music &quot;albums&quot; of the past few years-- like the Ricardo Villalobos and Omar S <em>Fabric</em> mixes, to name just two-- have managed to offer an hour-plus of (more-or-less) new music while also offering <em>motion</em>, an emotional/musical arc that justifies their running time. Especially with your more (there's no other word, sorry) minimal dance acts, the single-artist mix ideally prevents you from ever thinking, &quot;Have I just been listening to someone fiddle with their trackpad for the past five minutes?&quot; Or, &quot;Does this make me happy, or would I maybe be better off playing a Loverboy song?&quot;</p>\n<p>Ada's <em>Adaptations</em> collects 12 of the German producer's original tracks and remixes by and for other artists, strung into a mix that's neither as virtuosically deranged as Villalobos' or as functionally banging as Omar S'. Instead, it's one of the most inviting techno mixes/albums you'll hear this year, damn near cuddly. Don't mistake it for a pop record, though, or any sort of crossover stab, despite the preponderance of vocals and two indie-friendly covers. (Well, her remix of Brant's &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot; comes off more of a titular nod in the direction of certain Mancunians, its melody drooping electro melancholia, rather than the sprightly Johnny Marr version of same.) But a mix/album that opens with the warm-blanket-on-a-cold-day purr of Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thorn, and includes a twinkly Michael Mayer/Tobias Thomas take on the looped longing Ada sieved from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' &quot;Maps&quot;? That's pretty far from the forbidding clich\u00e9 of the all-beats-and-nothing-but techno mix.</p>\n<p>And when she goes purely (or almost) instrumental, Ada's taste still veers towards the laconic, blissful, and immediately appealing. The DJ Koze remix of &quot;Eve&quot;, perhaps the one true 21st-century classic on the mix, may open with a scratched-in flurry of hip-hop and feature a repeating vocal sample that's a chipmunk-squeaky nod to old-school rave. But its twanging bassline and Jonzun Crew synth-chirrups are buffeted by billowing keyboards you'd mistake for shoegaze glaze if they were played by guitars in a more rock-centric context. Robin Guthrie would nod with grandfatherly approval at the fluffy, reverb-drenched sound of much of <em>Adaptations</em>, its pleasantly floaty and frou-frou vibe. Even Ada's nods to trad dance sounds, like the quasi-Spanish &quot;guitar&quot; that lazily twangs through her remix of Andi Teichmann's &quot;Tape&quot;, are hazy in a manner more transmission-from-space than crisp, neo-Balearic banger.</p>\n<p>It's maybe just a tad funny that, as a mix, <em>Adaptations</em> is just okay. On the evidence, Ada belongs to the long-slow-fade school of transitions, which suits her fuzzy sonics well enough. It just doesn't provide many jolts or surprises, easing you from track to track with a chain of bleeps or two overlapping melody lines. (On the other hand, turntablist trickery would just sound awkward applied to tracks that unfurl rather than bend or twist.) Still, though the oomph gently leaks out over the final quarter, there's enough bounce in her beats and b-lines to keep the record from evaporating into indistinct ambiance. <em>Adaptations</em> glides quite gracefully between floor-filler and recliner-friendly.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This may be a difficult concept for you Dream Theater fanatics to grasp, but most of the time people aren't examining the finery of musical content as much as searching for something that simply captures the right tone. You can try to persuade me that tech-house is all in the details, but in a genre rife with strict guiding principles, Cologne-based singer-producer Michaela Dippel (aka Ada) is defiantly preoccupied with melody, a priority she uses to her iconoclastic advantage. She might be tech-house's version of the Strokes: Her new album <em>Blondie</em> is simple but slyly detailed, and exudes a self-assured cosmopolitan vibe.</p>\n<p>Part of <em>Blondie</em>'s success is due to Dippel's preference for a soft, steady kick drum, which gives her beaming melodies a lot of wiggle room. And she uses it: Like the works of many of her Cologne cohorts, everything gets chopped and transmogrified before being spit out. But Dippel is generally more direct than her peers; <em>Blondie</em> throbs with classic hooks, laid out in gushing aurora synths and purring vocals.</p>\n<p>&quot;Eve&quot; carries the album in on a wave of smooching synth beams, incorporating vocals before closing with a chirpy, fragmented faux-guitar solo. The song's approximation of a vocal hook is a slinky bit of bait: &quot;Close your eyes and wet your lips,&quot; Dippel sings, slipping in and out of various filters and harmonizations. &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; features a distorted animal cry, which-- along with a thumping bass line and shimmying dot-matrix squelches-- pins the song nearer Boards of Canada than Luomo. The track even delivers a chorus-- a set of pulsing, &quot;Drop It Like It's Hot&quot;-style synth changes that explode out of the bare, steely beat.</p>\n<p>If you're impatient, the album's middle third may seem bleak. But <em>Blondie</em> thrives on delayed pleasure, consistently turning hazy, going-nowhere beats into radiant climaxes. Most of the songs take a good four or five minutes to flower, but the finished product is almost always gratifying. Even the erratic seven-minute &quot;Our Love Never Dies&quot; recovers from a turbulent, tempo-less synth solo to find a viscous beat, which is slowly set aglow by a layered melody. &quot;Each and Everyone&quot;, a remix of 2002's sensational A-side &quot;Blindhouse&quot;, is the album's sparest, most orthodox moment; deriving clarity from Dippel's vocal and an icy bell-like melody, the track sounds like a decaffeinated Junior Boys.</p>\n<p>Ada ends <em>Blondie</em> with a whirl of dizzying pop-- her cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' &quot;Maps&quot;. Stretching and slowing the song's already austere melody, Ada proves the power of blushing sustained synth notes. Atop a more deliberate, broken-down melodic foundation instead of the original's bulldozer drumming and glowstik guitar line, the song's beautiful vocal takes on even greater tenderness. Karen O might be a hipster dream, but Ada is all dark sophistication. Her coy vocals and supple melodic sensibilities make it hard to hear <em>Blondie</em> and not walk away woozy and a little weak-kneed.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If avoiding categories is a virtue, praised be Add N to (X). When we first caught a glimpse of the band on the cover of its first record, featuring a garish and kitschy photograph in which a vintage Moog is pulled from a human stomach <em>Alien</em>-style, it was easy to peg them as some kind of retro art project, making music from the cast-off instruments of records past. That album confounded expectations, offering varied and inspired knob-twiddling that often worked against type. And here on their fourth album, it's now clear that Add N to (X) are very difficult to define and don't fit very well into any particular scene.</p>\n<p>Being on Mute and composing music primarily with keyboards, one wants to place Add N to (X) somewhere in the dance-pop continuum, but from the first track on <em>Loud Like Nature</em> this sort of classification is problematic. &quot;Total All Out Water&quot; is anthemic rock at the corner where Glam meets Classic, a corner Gary Glitter (his &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; drumbeat is stolen here) and David Bowie (circa &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot;) have been known to frequent. The riff is undeniable and the bass throb is sleazy, but it would sound like hell worked into a DJ set. This is music for cruising the L.A. freeway system with the top down.</p>\n<p>Add N to (X) have a fondness for natural drum sounds and generally eschew drum machines, which partly explains why the band often sounds so much more rock than one would expect. &quot;Sheez Mine&quot;, on the other hand, fits quite well into what's happening now in electroclash, with an appropriately stiff drumbeat, chanted lyrics expressing disgust, and an uptempo propulsion. The following &quot;Invasion of the Polaroid People&quot; makes another sharp left turn, with spoken word sections and weird sound effects that combine to sound very mid-90s, like something off the album Steven Jesse Bernstein did with Steve Fisk for Sub Pop. The vocals on &quot;Party Bag&quot; remind me of Neil Haggerty's neo-soul falsetto, but the music is thick analog grunge, all oscillating bass tones and messy noise settings. Despite the presence of a Theremin solo, it still sounds difficult to place in terms of era.</p>\n<p>All this variety is to be commended, but a lot of the tracks here sound like unfinished sketches. You find yourself waiting for the hook or chorus to kick in, and too often, it never does. For every &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, another catchy electro track with a great chorus riff, there's a &quot;P.P. Machine&quot; or &quot;Up the Punks,&quot; marginal between-song interludes that go on for four minutes, filled with enough interesting noises but fewer interesting ideas. Still, these moments of tedium, while too frequent, don't overwhelm the album, keeping <em>Loud Like Nature</em> on par with the bulk of Add N to (X)'s output. They may be hard to pigeonhole, but they're easy enough to like.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>There was a time when I sneered at analog purists. Tucked away in my room, with my computer, CD player, and digital Casio keyboard, I laughed at the fools who wasted their cash on fuzzy-sounding crap that can be almost perfectly replicated by software. I would chuckle to myself whenever I saw some poor sap dropping a grand on a vintage keyboard. After all, for a mere 200 smackeroos, all the sounds on that big, bulky keyboard, along with many others, can be compacted onto a small, friendly CD-ROM.</p>\n<p>This summer, all that changed. I was at a Guitar Center in New Jersey, and I spotted a compact, odd-looking keyboard from across the room. That day, I fell in love with a 1985 Korg Poly-800, a bizarre digital-analog hybrid made immensely popular by its powerful circuitry and affordable price. That, and the pitch bend joystick. Mmmmm...</p>\n<p>As soon as I brought my new love object home, I immediately understood the appeal of analog, especially as it relates to the creation of bizarre, quirky sounds. Something about knob-twiddling, or even compulsive button-pushing, just seems much more conducive to creative sound creation than sitting in front of a computer and clicking repeatedly.</p>\n<p>If you don't believe me, check out Add N to (X)'s debut album, <em>On the Wires of Our Nerves</em>, or to a lesser extent, their second album, <em>Avant Hard</em>. On these two albums, especially the former, the three members of Add N to (X) seemed to have a complete grasp over the infinite orgasmic joy of the analog synthesizer. On these albums, abrasive, insane sounds were extracted from a variety of analog synth sources, making for some of the damned coolest electronic music to grace the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the appeal of the analog synthesizer, like so many other toys, can't last forever. There are only so many parameters that can be edited, so many filters that can be applied, and so many oscillators that can be, uh, oscillated, before the newness wears off, and you find yourself seeking out &quot;new directions.&quot; Uh-oh.</p>\n<p><em>Add Insult to Injury</em> is the first Add N to (X) record to sound in the least bit forced. On both of their previous records, the plethora of amazing sounds incorporated, combined with some completely crazy &quot;songwriting,&quot; made for a truly exciting listen. Here, we see the group at a loss for new ideas and recycling strikingly similar melodies, sounds, and song structures over the course of 12 tracks.</p>\n<p><em>Add Insult to Injury</em>'s greatest weakness comes with the formula which seems to have generated about 1/3 of the songs on the album-- a vaguely surfish bassline, drums that would sound at home in cheesy 70's soundtracks, and sadly ambiguous synthesizer sounds. Yes, it's a cute formula, and it's in some ways more accessible than Add N to (X)'s earlier works. But there is a huge structural problem with this formula: by applying the same bass and drum backbone to slightly different songs, the awesome analog synthesizer noises that once constituted the bread and butter of the group's sound now seem to float aimlessly over the song, resulting in a disjointed mess.</p>\n<p>Despite this giant flaw, <em>Add Insult to Injury</em> does have a few exceptional moments. The funky &quot;Pokerole&quot; is one of the finest songs the group has penned, as is the album's single, the Bruce Haack-esque &quot;Plug Me In.&quot; The album's closing track, &quot;The Regent is Dead,&quot; is also pretty cool, utilizing a fucked-up analog marching band sound and some high-pitched, squelching blasts of pure analog joy.</p>\n<p>So it turns out that <em>Add Insult to Injury</em> may be a more apt title than the group had planned. For those of you disappointed by <em>Avant Hard</em>, this record may very well be the final straw. It's sad to hear a group that once had so much potential descend on a slippery slope towards mediocrity. Thus, <em>Add Insult to Injury</em> serves as a disappointing reminder that sounding cool can only get you so far.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30012-addison-groove/\">Addison Groove</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWfiog1Ure4\">&quot;Footcrab&quot;</a> was a flashpoint for footwork and juke music in 2010, providing UK audiences an anthem to rally around. The track was a special kind of stoopid, a pure pastiche whose innovation-- slowing footwork's daft repetitions to UK bass speeds-- was inevitable and whose only sliver of wit came via its childlike abstraction of Chicago's crude mantras. It was so blindingly obvious and addictive that there frankly wasn't much to be said about it (<a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1220\">see number five</a>). In the two years since &quot;Footcrab&quot;, peers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/\">Pearson Sound</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/\">Sepalcure</a> have found more nuanced applications of the Footwork sound, and Chicago originators like Traxman and DJ Rashad have toured Europe and released artist albums on Planet Mu. Addison Groove had impeccable timing, but the richest applications of the footwork template were coming from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Addison Groove-- n\u00e9 Antony Williams-- wasn't being lapped, though; he was casually refocusing, setting down footwork in favor of its more durable uncle, juke. His early singles in this style faithfully reproduced the rubbery basslines and 808 drum sounds but were somehow too oriented and dialed in. Straight recreations of this music-- which was produced cheaply and quickly-- might still yield fruit, but Williams' singles were long and thin. Count me among the surprised that his debut album, <em>Transistor Rhythm</em>, on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/\">Modeselektor</a>'s 50 Weapons, is so well thought and accomplished. He's still taking cues from Chicago's South Side veterans, but for the first time it feels like he's building something of his own. The tracks on <em>Transistor Rhythm</em> are coiled and weighty, dense and tough where their predecessors were diffuse and pliable.</p>\n<p>Williams accomplishes this by slowing juke's core elements-- hissy rhythms, virulent bass-- to dubstep tempos-- he stays, with exceptions, in a familiar 120-140 bpm pocket here-- and adding snatches of vocals and rave-y synth patches. He spins the mixture like a top, and the result is tight, controlled motion that peters out as your attention begins to wane. During the slightly homogeneous middle third of the record, he rarely misses his mark: &quot;Sooperlooper&quot; capitalizes on a squelchy, pinched synth; &quot;Ass Jazz&quot; features drums that hew tightly to a short, pugnacious bassline. On &quot;Skylight&quot;, clipped diva vocals threaten to untether from the rhythm section's wild orbit. When he stretches out on &quot;Incredibly Exhausted Bunny Ears&quot;, he visits the spacey synth pads of early 1990s UK acts like Orbital on Chicago's hot circuits.</p>\n<p>He's still not clever: Early-album tracks &quot;Bad Things&quot; and &quot;Beeps&quot; feature <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4159-spank-rock/\">Spank Rock</a> and aspire to the vulgar repetition of ghetto house. &quot;Fuck you, bitch,&quot; over, and over, and over. And there's nothing as sticky as &quot;Footcrab&quot;: Join me in not quite remembering the precise turns of &quot;Superlooper&quot; or &quot;Skylight&quot;. He never manages a Dance Mania tribute as personal and strange as Nina Kraviz's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=605bwlAz_iQ\">&quot;Ghetto Kraviz&quot;</a>. <em>Transistor Rhythm</em> has been met with mild disappointment by many bass music fans, but I don't hear it. Williams is no longer ahead of the curve, sure, but <em>Transistor Rhythm</em>'s finest moments come when he threatens to step away from the curve completely. It is an album of well-portioned, difficult grooves that owe as much to craftsmanship as they do to scholarship, the sound of a chronic disciple slowing learning to make his influences work for him.</p>\n",

Their synthesizers sound like museum pieces; their post-punk production reeks like a leaky dungeon. And their dry sense of humor keeps the listener perpetually off balance, the same way that their creepy cover art steadfastly refuses to meet the viewer\u2019s gaze. You never see a pair of eyes on the duo\u2019s record sleeves\u2014just covered faces, gloved hands, and ambiguously slumped poses, markers of contemporary alienation raised to the level of high art. If you were to describe their music in architectural terms, it would be part hall of mirrors, part <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House\">Winchester Mystery House</a>.</p>\n<p>For <em>Detroit House Guests</em>, their first album in four\u00a0years, the married duo\u2014both are <a href=\"http://www.kuperusandmiller.com/\">visual artists and filmmakers</a> as well as musicians\u2014went the opposite route: Assisted by a $40,000 Knight Foundation grant, they threw open the doors of their 4,000-square-foot compound in Detroit\u2019s New Center neighborhood, inviting a handpicked succession of artists to live and work with them. Some, like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/19817-nitzer-ebb/\">Nitzer Ebb</a>\u2019s Douglas J. McCarthy, they had known for years. The Austrian Thereminist Dorit Chrysler, on the other hand, had only a passing acquaintance with the duo before her residency. It was an \u201cintense\u201d process, Kuperus <a href=\"https://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/detroit-house-guests-create-album-motor-city\">has said</a>: \u201cBecause you\u2019re living together, you\u2019re having breakfast together, and when you\u2019re done with the studio you\u2019re watching Netflix together.\u201d That kind of intimacy is palpable across the album. While there\u2019s no mistaking ADULT.\u2019s wiry signature, their collaborators\u2019 input is largely indistinguishable from their own, leading to a record that is richer and stranger than anything the duo has done before.</p>\n<p>All of their usual hallmarks are here: spring-loaded drum programming, clammy reverb, brittle synths that clink like wind chimes in an ice storm. Classic electro remains a driving force, and on \u201cStop (and Start Again),\u201d featuring <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28720-light-asylum/\">Light Asylum</a>\u2019s Shannon Funchess bellowing over a flanged, high-necked bassline, they return to the hair-raising goth of 2005\u2019s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/58-gimme-trouble/\"><em>Gimme Trouble</em></a>. But a majority of the album\u2019s tracks find them foraging far beyond their usual stomping grounds. The opening \u201cP rts M ss ng,\u201d with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2610-lichens/\">Lichens</a>\u2019 <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/32854-robert-aiki-aubrey-lowe/\">Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe</a>, is slow and methodical, its modular synthesizers twitching like metal shavings under a magnet. \u201cBreathe On,\u201d with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/\">Swans</a>\u2019 <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5841-michael-gira/\">Michael Gira</a>, extends the meditative mood; Gira\u2019s basso purr verges on <a href=\"http://www.asmrlab.com/\">ASMR</a> territory, and the same could be said of the woozy third track, \u201cInto the Drum,\u201d with its disorienting soup of whispers and vocal fry.</p>\n<p>In fact, they don\u2019t unleash their usual body-moving assault until the fourth song, \u201cWe Are a Mirror,\u201d a chilly slab of death disco enlivened by Kuperus and McCarthy\u2019s call-and-response vocals. Just like his hosts, McCarthy sounds like he\u2019s ventured far from his comfort zone. Neither of his songs bear obvious traces of Nitzer Ebb\u2019s abrasive legacy; instead, he seems determined to twist his formidable baritone into the most unexpected shapes. Ironically, it falls to Funchess to deliver the album\u2019s best Nitzer Ebb impersonation: Her \u201cWe Chase the Sound\u201d is a dead ringer for the EBM pioneers\u2019 scorched-earth funk.</p>\n<p>Throughout, ADULT.\u2019s synthetic sound world is unusually electrifying. On \u201cInexhaustible,\u201d abetted by Chrysler\u2019s Theremin, they conjure a mercurial fusion of Morton Subotnick and early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/\">Depeche Mode</a>. And on \u201cUncomfortable Positions,\u201d the conceptual textile artist <a href=\"http://www.lunnamenoh.com/2011.html\">Lun*na Menoh</a> performs on a modified sewing machine whose darting needle wobbles like a quarter spinning down. Strangest of all is \u201cThis Situation,\u201d which sounds like an eight-minute tribute to the Beatles\u2019 notorious <em>musique concr\u00e8te</em> experiment \u201cRevolution 9.\u201d Over rumbling abstractions, two snippets of Kuperus\u2019 voice loop in parallel. \u201cForgive me if I change the usual order of the menu,\u201d runs one; \u201cThis situation can\u2019t go on indefinitely,\u201d goes the other, more or less indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The album\u2019s most fascinating aspect is the way it affords a glimpse behind the duo's masks. The closing \u201cAs You Dream,\u201d in which Michael Gira does his best Tibetan monk impersonation, is a damn-near liturgical take on drone techno\u2014not so much hermetic as immersive, a rising tide spilling out their front door and subsuming everything in its path. ADULT. still do a convincing showroom-dummies impersonation, but they\u2019ve never sounded more human than they do here.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/25-adult/\">ADULT.</a> never quite fit in with the electroclash outfits they were grouped in with during their rise to sorta-fame in the early 2000s. Detroit's Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus had the same mix of dance music sounds and punk aesthetics that their largely New York-based peers did, but none of the downtown glitz and coked-up post-9/11 escapism. Instead they projected something more intense and unsettling, a faceless anxiety that pitched French existentialist horror through a bleak Midwestern Rust Belt worldview.</p>\n<p>Over a decade after the release of their first album, most of ADULT.\u2019s electroclash-affiliated contemporaries have fallen off the map, and the post-millennial tension that made them seem so timely back then has evolved into something different. But that sense of deep alienation still pervades <em>The Way Things Fall</em>, the duo\u2019s fifth\u00a0 album, although like the music it\u2019s embedded in, it\u2019s become subtler and more intriguing.</p>\n<p>The pair\u2019s approach to making music has previously relied heavily on discomfort: synthesizers and drum machines EQ\u2019d to remove whatever hints of warmth they might once have had, Kuperus\u2019 monotone delivery a microtone off key, an aura of harsh, treble-heavy distortion surrounding pretty much everything. On <em>The Way Things Fall</em>, though, they\u2019ve dialed down the more outright aggression, and aimed more directly for pop appeal than ever before. Everything\u2019s cleaner, smoother, and considerably less prickly.</p>\n<p>The apotheosis of this new approach is \u201cTonight, We Fall\u201d, an easily accessible piece of sleek new wave engineering, with a straightforward rock drum beat, burbling bass, and a recurring synth lead that sticks mainly to a major scale and only barely veers into the kind of woozy pitch bends that are one of the pair\u2019s favorite discomfiting compositional techniques. Kuperus backs up the broadly hooky vocal melody with an emotional performance verging on the melodramatic, and far removed from her usual angry-cyborg style.</p>\n<p>Kuperus and Miller haven\u2019t exactly transformed into affable pop artists, though. This newfound emphasis on catchiness is just another vehicle for delivering the same kind of unease that ADULT.\u2019s always specialized in. It\u2019s just sneakier now. On its surface \u201cTonight, We Fall\u201d reads like a straightforward swooning love song. Kuperus opens the song by asking, \u201cWill we, will we live like this/ Forever,\u201d which is the kind of vaguely philosophical inquiry that we expect a bittersweet new wave love song to ask. But when Kuperus answers her own question things get complicated. \u201cThis feeling came over me,\u201d she sings, \u201cIt sticks to you, sticks to me/ Forever.\u201d If it\u2019s love she\u2019s talking about, like the song\u2019s tone sets us up to expect, it doesn\u2019t sound like something you\u2019d want to touch. It sounds more like a curse.</p>\n<p>Using well-worn pop tropes to establish a set of expectations in the listener only to subvert them as thoroughly as possible is a pattern that repeats itself throughout <em>The Way Things Fall</em>. The stacked arpeggios on \u201cLove Lies\u201d sets up an unhurried <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3075-gary-numan/\">Gary Numan</a> groove that Kuperus uses as a platform to declaim on the falseness of human emotion. \u201cHeartbreak\u201d comes on like a 70s space disco jam then drops a creepily dissonant chromatic bridge that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Of course this kind of anxiety is exactly what ADULT.\u2019s fans want from them. For whatever perverse reasons we want to be unsettled by their music, and made psychically uncomfortable. They\u2019ve always delivered, but never before with this sense of style.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It shouldn't be too controversial for me to say that <em>most</em> bands get more normal as they go along-- they refine themselves, expand their audiences, raise their production values, and clean up all those leftover quirks from back when they didn't think too many people were paying attention anyway. ADULT., being giant weirdos, are one of those bands who've done the opposite, getting progressively more strange and insular. The music on <em>Why Bother?</em> may not be leagues away from the shrieky, gothic electro-punk that's become their signature, but it <em>is</em> different, and it's definitely stranger: Suddenly ADULT. are coming to you from somewhere inside what would seem to be a giant tank of very cold water. These are the same blurting drum machines and scratchy bass lines, but they've gone a bit distant and woozy, with hazy reverb and detuned synths wobbling all around.</p>\n<p>Well: Getting more accessible was always a long shot for an act this single-mindedly concerned with themes of discomfort, anxiety, and annoyance. That stuff isn't going anywhere, as a glance at the tracklist will confirm. The lead single is &quot;I Feel Worse When I'm with You&quot;, a classically ADULT. barnstormer whose video depicts a day in the Adam Lee Miller/Nicola Kuperus household as a string of attempts to kill either themselves or one another; it's surrounded by tracks like &quot;You Don't Worry Enough&quot;, &quot;Inclined to Vomit&quot;, and &quot;Plagued by Fear.&quot; Kuperus's imagination still focuses on nausea, weapons, panic attacks, poison, CPR, taxidermy, and those murder-mystery photographs of people who may be unconscious but are probably dead-- you know, typical Michigan stuff. Rest assured that they have some sense of humor/irony about these things, if not always as much as you'd like.</p>\n<p>And this record backs off on the punk charge (and the goth affectations) to let that good-times creepshow just sit and simmer. &quot;Red Herring&quot; has Kuperus actually singing, melodically-- for the first time in a while-- as an eerie, clanging synth backing runs in place like a giant machine; same goes for the terrific &quot;Good Deeds&quot;, whose tempo is actually so high that the whole thing winds up feeling ominously static. Elsewhere, &quot;Harvest&quot; is all industrial ambience, while two parts of something called &quot;The Importance of Being Folk&quot; serve as soundtrack music to a short film involving needlepoint, a rusty axe, and a hexagram. None of this, however, stops the band from delivering some of the deliciously grating, high-energy stuff fans expect: &quot;Inclined to Vomit&quot; is pure pound and screech, and &quot;You Don't Worry Enough&quot; unleashes some hesher-friendly fuzz bass for what feels like the closest ADULT. will ever get to cock rock.</p>\n<p>Stranger and stranger, then, and yet we all still know what kind of world we're being invited into with each new ADULT. release: Slow or fast, clean or dirty, underwater or above ground, fans of nerves, paranoia, and the inability to speak will always get what's coming to them. It's a little disappointing that none of the band's stylistic shifts have let them bloom into much more, but as furrows for ploughing go, this one's still pretty fascinating, and still all theirs.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A funny thing happened the last time I saw Adult. Someone in the crowd requested their 2001 electro favorite &quot;Hand to Phone&quot;, which wasn't so strange. Nicola Kuperus said she was sick to death of singing that song, which wasn't so unusual either. But then-- then she <em>did</em> start singing it, in an eye-rolling parody of her old robot monotone: hand to phone, hand to phone, blah blah blah.</p>\n<p>I can't think of much better shorthand for the group's career arc-- abandoning those pitch-perfect light-speed electronics and diving off into a world of potentially embarrassing basement trainwrecks. Kuperus traded icy drone for the kind of witchy yelping not much heard since Bauhaus's prime. Adam Lee Miller traded clean-line synth flash for nasty bass-guitar buzz. They added a guitar player; they spazzed out. And as much as each new release came out like a total mess, there was something in each of them that's totally fascinating, as if each of those risky sounds-- from cyborg post-punk to cheerleader pogo goth-- was one wobbly, perilous step in the direction of something much greater. The only question: when-- or whether-- they'd ever break past the wobbles and come out with whatever that great thing was.</p>\n<p>Is that thing <em>Gimme Trouble</em>? Not quite-- but this is a whole lot closer than anything we've heard so far. For one thing, there's the sound, which has perked up beautifully. Drum machine pump, bass blurt, synth clatter, guitar screech-- they all mesh clean and shiny here, and on some tracks they take on a slanty, minimalist bounce that practically breaks a smile. &quot;Bad Idea&quot; kicks off sounding like early Devo, something from an era where weirdoid punk and synthesizers got along naturally. The go-go drum machine and one-note guitar on &quot;Still Waiting&quot; leave the whole thing feeling vaguely like an early B-52's rave-up. Half the rest sounds like X-Ray Spex or Siouxsie and the Banshees-- there is vintage new wave rawness and goth-inflected bounce all over this thing, and it manages to leave this band in fresh-sounding territory that's somehow miles away from most everything today's &quot;new wave revivalists&quot; and/or &quot;electro-punks&quot; have even thought about trying. Best of all: no mess. No little time-trials, or side-notes, or half-formed clatters-- just 12 songs that, while somewhat lacking in super-blazing stand-outs, present a giant step up in coherence.</p>\n<p>That's good news: It doesn't feel so &quot;confrontational&quot; anymore, does it? With their last full-length, <em>Anxiety Always</em>, it sounded like they were challenging us, deliberately nag-nag-nagging us with the shriekiest, most paranoid rumble they could muster. That was fun, in its way, and it's certainly not as if they've dropped that agenda. But the Adult. on this record can be &quot;fun&quot; in a much more pleasant, straightforward way-- the same jump-around-and-screech-along way their early electro singles could be. The only thing that still worries me is the memory of them on stage, with Kuperus posing and sneering and genuinely trying to act out the cretinous-vampire schtick the band's been working its way through. Are we going to have to get Devo and Fred Schneider to come wave the landing lights and guide them to the sweet spot? This isn't scary tough-guy muscle, guys-- it's spazzed-out pogo geek-punk, and it's almost nearly there. Cover &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; if you have to.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>I've gotta hand it to Adult.: They're more willing than most to follow their muse into potentially embarrassing spots. Yeah, they started off faultless; the strobe-light electro on their early singles was so precise that you had to assume they knew exactly what they were doing. But then comes their first LP, and geez: Suddenly they're playing shabby bass lines, the drum machine's booming from some corner of a crappy basement, and the whole shrill thing sounds as much like an art-school trainwreck as a sneaky reinvention. A single like &quot;Don't You Stop&quot; could reassure you that they were bringing it all back home to their strong suit, but then here we are with the <em>D.U.M.E.</em> EP, about which let's say this: It's certainly the logical extension of that full-length. The upshot of these six tracks seems to be that Adult. have been listening to a hell of a lot of Bauhaus. And I have to give them credit: They've followed that impulse right out to the sweet spot.</p>\n<p>Because every time I think they've finally spun off into some dippy little world that I don't need to visit, they manage to pull me back onto their side. The shrieky basement goth on <em>D.U.M.E.</em> seems at first like a pretty cringeworthy development, even if you go for this kind of thing; you sort of want to let Nicola Kuperus know that yelpy witch vocals (half Peter Murphy, half Patti Smith) might not be her calling, or tell Adam Lee Miller he's better with discfloor programming than weird muddy stomps. But give it a few spins, and it starts to seem pretty useful: Who else these days is going to turn your bedroom into a bat cave? Everyone pillages the Reagan era, but who's willing to sound like a pack of raccoon-eyed art-school freaks from 1984? The sound is shrill and ridiculous, sure, but here's the half-remembered secret with this kind of stuff: No matter how self-important it may have sounded, being shrill and ridiculous was half the fun. You don't sing along with &quot;Bela Lugosi's Dead&quot; for its deep spiritual qualities; you just enjoy making the faces and doing the voice, and you're probably laughing while you're at it.</p>\n<p>That's pretty much what's on offer here and Adult., as always, have a knack for embarrassing themselves in a good way. The propulsive drum programming on &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; turns it into pogo cheerleading goth, or some vampire version of the B-52s; go-go bounce and weirdo yelping both make like the dark side of &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;. The rest is a bit more of a pileup, but the bass crawl on the title track sounds like the earliest, creepiest version of the Cocteau Twins, and I'm a sucker for the Bauhaus-replica guitar that crops up everywhere else.</p>\n<p>It's a mess, as usual, but this band has a terrific excuse: So long as no one else is willing to go quite this far out on a limb, it's not like you can say some other group is doing it better. Here's hoping they've got more high-energy sneering for their next full length, because when they're really rocking this stuff, it's a whole lot more fun than anything else on the rack.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The first thing to note is that it's a wonderful thing when bands change. By this I mean when bands genuinely change: not when they &quot;mature&quot; or when they &quot;incorporate subtle electronic flourishes,&quot; but when they actually surprise you, popping up like friends who've been gone for years and reappear with bold new haircuts.</p>\n<p>Adult. have pretty much changed. Their twelve-inch records so far-- most of them collected on the <em>Resuscitation</em> CD-- have been stocked with some of the buzziest, punkiest electro going, as well as some of the hookiest: their nervous strobelight grind couldn't have been any less opposed to the pop sensibility it was standing on. Their last single, a happily shouty bouncer called &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, had at least a few of us expecting their first proper album to be some sort of fine-tuned pop breakthrough. And it is, but not nearly in the way you'd think.</p>\n<p>The definitive departure here comes on a track called &quot;Glue Your Eyelids Together&quot;, which you can tell is sort of a mission statement when you notice the picture in the liners of Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus doing exactly that. Look carefully: Miller's bottle of Elmer's is rebranded Ersatz Audio. And then listen as casually as you want, and you'll still notice that Miller is now playing bass.</p>\n<p>Right: everyone's always called them &quot;punks&quot;, and now they're living up to it by being post-punks. The drum machine, previously popping forcefully in the center of the mix, now blurts and snaps from one corner of a very large room. Somewhere closer is Miller, charging sharply around on a massively fuzzed-up bassline. And right there in our collective face, her taunting chant no longer processed into tech-land, is Kuperus, bouncing and cheerleading: &quot;Glue your eyelids together! Glue your eyelids together!&quot;</p>\n<p>This time the &quot;post-punk&quot; isn't a metaphor. The sound has plenty to do with what happened when the artier punks of the late 70s started messing with synths, like a hyper child's redrawing of Cabaret Voltaire's &quot;Nag Nag Nag&quot;-- and a little to do with the evil-techie buzz that's come out of the Pacific Northwest more recently (see: Mocket's &quot;Monitress&quot;). And like a lot of the best post-punk, this is going to sound like a great shoddy mess to a whole lot of people: just the raw pulse of a four-note bass slice, punchy synth exclamations, needling sneers from Kuperus, and a great big slap of a snare drum keeping pace. It will provoke hatred and eye-rolling and accusations of soulless charlatanism, and at least one acquaintance has declared it &quot;the most annoying thing ever recorded.&quot; But it's also terrifically, needlingly catchy, bratty fist-in-the-air catchy: in its best moments it sounds like Joy Division having a panic attack.</p>\n<p>Which is, of course, Adult.'s whole business: <em>Anxiety Always</em>, it's called, and there's even more jittery, spazzy insistence here than on those twelve-inches. There's also more of the deeper, more ominous exploration that filled some of those records' b-sides: the album creeps ominously in on the instrumental swell of &quot;The Cold Call&quot;, and its second half opens equally slowly, repeating, tangling, and rearranging one line: &quot;People: you can confuse them.../ Into a disorienting babble.&quot;</p>\n<p>There's also something of the Adult. of old, only the hyper-precise turnarounds are subdued into a careful trance: &quot;Shake Your Head&quot; bubbles and flutters with dangerous purpose, and &quot;Kick in the Shin&quot;-- pictured on rear CD tray-- has an almost-smooth gloss on its deep electro, with Kuperus very nearly crooning over it. The rigidly groovy pop of &quot;Don't Stop&quot; comes back on another high point, &quot;Nothing of the Kind&quot;, which is filled with a weird, scratchy twang that makes you imagine Miller wearing a cowboy hat as he plays its treble-heavy bassline. The big field trips come on &quot;We Know How to Have Fun&quot;, a blurry, murky void you can spend hours parsing, and the new &quot;Nervous (Wreck)&quot;, a complex and evil-sounding instrumental that feels like the soundtrack to an old video game about werewolves.</p>\n<p>But we're also gluing our eyelids together, and from there it escalates. &quot;Blank Eyed, Nose Bleed&quot; wraps its synths' brittle zapping with another paranoid cheer: &quot;I've been working on increasing my anxiety!&quot; Here I should remind you that Adult. really do have a sense of humor. Remembering this may be necessary to get through &quot;Turn Your Back&quot;-- which is not to say that they're joking, but Kuperus is going to go &quot;neh neh neh&quot; at you, and you're going to want to be on her side when it happens.</p>\n<p>Because that's the sort of wonderful change this is: a high-wire hop, the kind of shift that tries to walk fearlessly onto a patch of ground surrounded by pitfalls. It's tempting to call it one of the most messily brilliant things we'll see all year, but it can't, in good faith, be recommended to everyone: if the duo's buzzy neurosis was enough to drive some people nuts before, the raw jumping and nagging of <em>Anxiety Always</em> will sound to many like the shoddiest, most amusical sham to be held up as a masterpiece in many of our lives. No joke: this album would annoy all hell out of some of you, would sound like everything cruel about music wrapped into a single package whose creators seem actively proud that they couldn't care less. But if you're at all ready to run with it, you might find yourself in one of the more fun positions music lovers can get into: wondering for ten minutes whether you're hearing an embarrassing wreck or a stroke of genius, and then realizing in an ecstatic flash that it is so the latter.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Adult. isn't so much a &quot;band&quot; in the conventional sense as it is a pair of superheroes, done up in epaulettes and cigarette-leg trousers, embroiled in a glorious struggle to make life on Earth vastly more enjoyable for you and yours. By the same token, <em>Resuscitation</em>, a reformatted collection of their 12-inch singles, isn't so much an &quot;album&quot; as it is the soundtrack to an alternately beautiful and hilarious fantasy world, one where kids dressed like Central European intelligence agents congregate in dark clubs to bang heads and twitch spasmodically until they're utterly, magnificently spent. It's made half of my thoughts about little words like &quot;electro&quot; and &quot;punk&quot; cringe in its great looming shadow; it's made me bounce and shout like a ninny more than anything else I've heard in years. My personal enthusiasm for this record knows no bounds, and I can only hope that it's mildly contagious.</p>\n<p>They're from Detroit: Adam Lee Miller, who makes sequencers race and pound, and Nicola Kuperus, whose every communication with us is designed to imply convoluted intrigues surrounding it. I wrote last month that they &quot;think they're punks,&quot; but their records sweep away the concept-- the tracks on <em>Resuscitation</em> function as grim, stripped-bare techno, razor-sharp synth-pop, and snarling electro-punk, but most of all they just blaze effortlessly away. The drum machines are sharp and propulsive, hissing and spitting while the programming, grainy as all get-out, ping-pongs furiously around itself, building and collapsing in a light-speed flurry of hooks. (You can dance to it if you have massive amounts of frustrated energy, a strong heart, and enough room that you won't accidentally hurt anyone.) Kuperus' vocals, obsessed with communication, miscommunication, privacy, and consumption, range from a blank chant to a wounded sing-song, clipped and processed into a state that's less robotic than distant and distorted. The overall effect is like listening to a strobe light.</p>\n<p>All of this makes them sound angry and cold, which they're not: their best tracks walk the same fine line as Gary Numan's &quot;Cars&quot;, offering up both slamming beats and pop hooks perfect for bemused driver's-seat posing. It's tempting to think that at least Miller has some metal in his past, because the tone is the same; his tightly arranged kicks and slams seem lighthearted, meant for entertainment and less a product of aggression than flat-out, amped-up good times.</p>\n<p>What sets Adult. apart from their peers, aside from the hyperactive blur of their songs, is the amount of attention they pay to form and detail: every measure brings new tricks, sprinting programs turning acrobatically on dimes, running circles around themselves in perfectly choreographed conversations with the vocals. These tracks come across as fierce pop songs that would make just as interesting instrumentals, which, with the pasted-together collages of vocal snippets, some of them really are. And once one can get past <em>Resuscitation</em>'s massive dose of <em>Loveless</em> syndrome (e.g. a signature sound unique enough that the tracks run together somewhat), it becomes apparent just how flexible the duo's approach is.</p>\n<p>&quot;Skinlike&quot;, the collection's most beautiful moment, soars like A Flock of Seagulls; &quot;Nausea&quot;, its most light-hearted, stomps determinedly along while Kuperus repeatedly chews up and spits out its title, his posing and preening almost audible. The wonderfully misanthropic &quot;Human Wreck&quot; reaches heights of buzzing industrial grind-- like The Normal's bleak &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; done over as hard techno by agit-prop guerillas-- but the surprisingly wistful &quot;Contagious&quot; has Kuperus singing her sad message over a sunny major-key lilt. That message runs like this: &quot;Your signal failed-- but I know you're contagious.&quot;</p>\n<p>It's worth referencing the cover art here for Kuperus' photography, which adorns many releases on Adult.'s label, Ersatz Audio. Her striking agenda is the creation of scenes that function as stills from non-existent espionage thrillers: what convoluted plot climax could have led to the scene we see on <em>Resuscitation</em>'s cover? Her lyrics are another grab-bag of high-tech anxieties: in &quot;Pressure Suit&quot; it's the smoke from her own flaming boots that gives her the privacy to speak, and the hook to &quot;Hand to Phone&quot;, the smoothest-running single here, chants, &quot;She speaks to you in monotone/ Why can't I come over?&quot; Elsewhere, it's blank furniture in empty rooms, handbags full of money, &quot;lovesick minors at night,&quot; and, of course, all that neurotic nausea.</p>\n<p>It's terrifically conceived and even more terrifically crafted, the sort of record so perfect in its own aims that parsing out influences or agendas seems a fool's game. These tracks, this duo, this entity that is Adult.: they're a great and interesting thing, this nation's best inducers of head-banging, high-speed driving, amazed chuckles, and giddy bedroom shout- and/or pose-alongs. They really are superheroes, I swear it-- and when I'm listening to them, the bulk of everything else I've heard since I first heard them seems pointless and humorless, uptight and dull in the face of the massive amounts of fun these two seem to be having. I encourage you to join us.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The music made during <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/\">New Order</a>'s fantastic streak in the 1980s often carried a tragic, crestfallen tone-- understandable results for a band that emerged from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/\">Joy Division</a>'s still-fresh remains. But that large period of the band's work contains a euphoric feeling of escapism as well; it's still too easy, after all, to put on a song like &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Ii0K77K1k\">Bizarre Love Triangle</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmZqi1PnHwU\">This Time of Night</a>&quot; and lose yourself to a place of limitless bliss. It's that electronic escapism that flushes the cheeks of Baltimore-based electronic musician Benny Boeldt's sophomore effort as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/19457-adventure/\">Adventure</a>, <em>Lesser Known</em>. From the syncopated pulse of aptly named opener &quot;Open Door&quot;, it's impossible not to draw comparisons to Sumner and co., as well as the best of the best 80s British synth-pop acts. Unlike the frequent blockiness of new wave, though, <em>Lesser Known</em> sounds expansive and maximalistic in design, as squelching synth runs fill up every last bit of possible space on the record's front half.</p>\n<p>Certainly, Benny knows how to do the maximalist thing pretty well; his background in Baltimore's Wham City art scene, as well as Adventure's chiptune-swarmed <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12477-adventure/\">self-titled debut</a>, fortifies a reputation for Loud and Big sounds. It's his first record's 8-bit confrontational, intermittently aggravating construction, then, that reveals its head on the album's back end, in the form of aggressively sinister synth-padded dance music. There's moments of heavy-lidded bliss in the dark oscillations of &quot;Another World&quot;, but the spinning-class insistence of &quot;Lights Out&quot;, as well as the sine wave noise terrorism of &quot;Meadows&quot;, achieve annoyance rather than transcendence. It suggests that Boeldt hasn't yet fully exorcised the ghost of Wham City's calling card all-everything assault just yet, as the somewhat unintentionally goofy <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/611-adventure/2277-relax-the-mind/\">clip</a> for a remix of &quot;Relax the Mind&quot; further suggests.</p>\n<p>Despite those hurdles, <em>Lesser Known</em> feels like a riskily successful work of growth from Boeldt, and it rightly should: this LP marks his first time trying his hand at singing. He's not exactly a professional or anything, but he goes for it anyway with often great success, brightly emoting with an open stride on &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; and getting rubbery, like a pop version of R&amp;B abstractionist <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/\">Autre Ne Veut</a>, on &quot;Fool's Paradise&quot;. <em>Lesser Known</em>, then, is about self-exploration in unexplored territory, and how to lose yourself in that void. Boeldt's escaped, and it sounds like he's all the better for it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Adventure's Benny Boeldt, like others of the Nintendo generation, draws inspiration from the 1980s-era 8-bit video game music of composers like Koji Kondo and Hip Tanaka. Game developers and composers have naturally moved on since that Golden Age, taking full advantage of increased storage and faster machines. If you play &quot;Rock Band&quot;, you've certainly heard AC/DC's &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; in crystal clarity, while EA Sports pumps out CD-quality jock jams in all their recent titles. Still, the wonky buzzsaw of the chiptune aesthetic continues to draw hardcore fans of its retro sound.</p>\n<p>Crystal Castles, who've helped to kickstart the most recent 08(-bit) conversation, were named after the Atari game but can't really be called chiptunes-- to these ears, they channel the electroclash movement with the judicious support of a few bygone beeps. Conversely, Benny Boeldt isn't really into video games these days, and he doesn't consider himself a chiptunes composer. But his debut record is heavily indebted to Sega and Nintendo themes. Bearing the same name as the popular Atari 2600 game, Adventure's self-titled full-length explores a curious style that once required a composer to deftly balance melody, counterpoint, and rhythm with the constraints of a couple of simple pulse channels and bursts of random static.</p>\n<p>Perhaps fittingly, Boeldt looks to co-opt this delicate process, wielding a simple sound wave as a double-edged broadsword rather than a scalpel. His pieces, unfettered by the four-channel restriction, charge forward with hyper-melodic and extremely hooky passages, often imbuing a lyrical touch. Tracks like &quot;Travel Kid&quot; and closer &quot;Jurassic Park City&quot; recall the bubblegum abandon of the Human League or New Order (suggested overtly by the machine-gun &quot;Blue Monday&quot; beat driving the latter). While <em>Blade Runner</em> samples float around &quot;Poison Diamonds&quot;, a high-pitched synth yearn skitters straight out of the Yellow Magic Orchestra playbook, perhaps expressing the same humanity jones as the replicants from the Ridley flick.</p>\n<p>Boeldt's tracks also suffer from an extreme case of attention deficit, rife with dizzingly arpeggiated passages that often breathe but just as often hyperventilate. By the time you get to the aptly named 8-bit blues of &quot;Wild Wild Ride&quot;, you've been push-pulled up and down the minor scale so much that you're checking yourself for internal organ damage. It's no surprise that Boeldt hails from the Baltimore-based Wham City collective, as he's got the same issues that sometimes trip up fellow Whammer Dan Deacon: losing the distinction between giddy maximalism and plain ol' <em>too much</em>. But it's best not to overthink <em>Adventure</em>. When you're in the car and you hear nearby drivers bumping jock jams or AC/DC, you can probably take pleasure in popping this in, because while they're only cruising up the street or down the highway, you're headed off to some distant, perilous, pixilated world.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>These reissues arrive just a few months too late to catch the red-hot apex of 70s New York revivalism, but that doesn't mean they're any less welcome: with all the attention Television have received lately, it's been strange to see their masterpiece, <em>Marquee Moon</em>, stuck in a bin with all the other old classics at the record store, in a barebones edition with a blue &quot;Super Saver&quot; sticker on the wrapper.</p>\n<p>Television, along with the other 70s legends that inspired the recent reintroduction of guitars, punk and garage-rock to the mainstream, are continually rediscovered by new breeds of NYC hipsters looking to start their own bands. The group's place in history has been resacramented again and again, so by now the backstory's old hat-- you know, the one about them kicking Richard Hell out of the band before they cut their first single, playing gigs and publishing verse with Patti Smith, and talking the owner of the then-unknown CBGB's to host shows of other genres than just &quot;country, bluegrass, and blues&quot; (which also makes them largely to blame for all those people that wear the club's t-shirts).</p>\n<p>You can read first-hand accounts and second-hand analyses of all these events, and one thing you'll uncover is the debate over how &quot;punk&quot; Television was. Sure, they joined the movement from the beginning, playing out as early as 1973, and they harnessed the energy you associate with punk, even as they crossed it with art-rock and the poetic urges of frontman Tom Verlaine (nee Miller, renamed after the French poet-- but not in a fey way). But they were also a rock band that roared through long, tense jams: When I first heard &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, it somehow felt like I'd already been exposed to it on a classic rock station wedged between Steve Miller and Skynyrd.</p>\n<p>With all that context, the most interesting thing about picking up Television's <em>Marquee Moon</em>-- today, for us folks who weren't old enough to buy the first edition vinyl-- is how ahistorical it sounds. If you listen to their original Brian Eno-produced demos, you hear a scragglier, faster band that's less confident and more... punk? If nothing else, the band at least sounded closer to the sometimes-sloppy Bowery clubrats Eno must have taken them for on those early tapes. Their sound on <em>Marquee Moon</em>, though, is clean, raw and simple. The band never breaks for a squall of energy, yet the whole record crackles with it, and they never rely on atmosphere to make their case. Billy Ficca's drums and Fred Smith's bass are extra lean and crisp, and the band's so tight that even the &quot;Did you feel low?&quot; call-and-response on &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; sounds amusingly rehearsed. The only rough edge is Tom Verlaine's striking warble, a somewhat choked-off tenor influenced either by Patti Smith or by someone kicking him in the throat.</p>\n<p>But the things that make the record so classic, that pump your blood like a breath of clean air, are the guitars. This whole record's a mash note to them. The contrast between these two essential leads is stunning: Richard Lloyd chisels notes out hard while Verlaine works with a subtle twang and a trace of space-gazing delirium. They play lines that are stately and chiming, rutting and torrential, the riff, the solo, the rare power chord, and most of all, the power <em>note</em>: the second pang on the riff to &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; lands like a barbell; the opening bars of &quot;See No Evil&quot; show one axe rutting the firmament while the other spirals razorwire around it.</p>\n<p>If Jose Feliciano had rearranged &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; the way he ruined &quot;Light My Fire&quot;-- by emphasizing the melody and lyrics and ditching the solos-- he'd have failed Television even worse than he did The Doors; every part of the song is a bridge to the monstrous Verlaine showpiece, and yet his guitar solo has no bombast: it climbs and soars in tangible increments, edging its way up scales and pounding like a contained explosion. The structural integrity makes this an Eiffel Tower in a world of Burning Men: in a decade full of guitarists spraying sweat on the arenas, Verlaine comes off like a man punching through ceilings.</p>\n<p>Rhino's remastered release of 1977's <em>Marquee Moon</em> adds a few alternate takes; for example, you can hear &quot;See No Evil&quot; with guitar solos scrawled all over the verses. But you also get the first-ever CD release of &quot;Little Johnny Jewel&quot;, a raw single that twangs and skitters around Verlaine's bug-eyed singing. So if you're new to Television but shy about picking up this bedrock masterpiece for the first time, just tell the cutie at the record store that you're buying it for that single, which alone would be worth the price.</p>\n<p>With <em>Marquee Moon</em> entrenched in the canon, it's more interesting to revisit their 1978 follow-up, <em>Adventure</em>. This record has always suffered by comparison, mainly because it's so easy to relate it to the first record: the arrangements and the aesthetic are roughly the same, but the music is quieter and more reflective, and that means less horsepower. It's not weak or even very different from their debut, but you might be disappointed when the earth doesn't cave beneath your feet.</p>\n<p>There isn't a weak song here, even if you count the abandoned title track, which is restored here as a bonus cut. &quot;Carried Away&quot;, the best ballad on either album, floats away on an organ instead of a guitar; &quot;The Fire&quot; sounds as melodramatic as &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; but a lot less Stygian. And while &quot;Foxhole&quot; and &quot;Ain't That Nothin'&quot; wouldn't have broken the flow on <em>Marquee Moon</em>, there's a sense that they're going in a different direction but with the same tools. The reissue is great-- especially for the bonus &quot;Ain't That Nothin'&quot; instrumental runthrough-- but a new Television listener would probably be tempted to check out a whole different experience by picking up the live albums, <em>The Blow-Up</em> or Rhino Handmade's new <em>Live at the Old Waldorf</em>.</p>\n<p>Television broke up after <em>Adventure</em>, and like typical mid-level rockers who fade away instead of dying, they went on to other projects, cut a reunion album in 1992, and still play occasional shows to this day. Writing this up now, it's hard not to feel out of place as someone too young to have caught their shows while the world is bursting with tributes and nostalgia from the people who loved them back when. But if my generation only inherited the band, then this release enshrines it again as something timeless, like that Greek sculpture the band once namechecked that shows motion and grace no matter what museum it's displayed in. Rhino and labels in the future will keep carbon-dating and explaining <em>Marquee Moon</em>, but sometime in the future, some Martian kid who can't get dates and hates sports will look past the plaque and sit in his room, blaring this music and wondering how life can possibly sound this great.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Since the release of his 2002 debut, <em>Invention</em>, I have been quick to purchase, post-haste and unheard, any album bearing Daedelus' name. The album's sound, largely sourced from old 78s, created one of the more unique sounds in IDM this decade, and worked primarily due to his clear respect for the material: he never aimed to displace so much as a crackle, fearing he might disrupt the musty spirit of the samples that attracted him to them in the first place. It hasn't hurt that his sense of humor has always shone through as well, from last year's brief <em>Household</em> EP, to the quirky avant-nostalgic production behind the Busdriver &amp; Radioinactive's <em>The Weather</em>.</p>\n<p>But something's happened. Late 2003's <em>Rethinking the Weather</em>, a Daedelus-spawned remix of his work on the aforementioned Busdriver &amp; Radioinactive LP, was atrocious-- a lukewarm, unfocused (and unnecessary) compilation of reworked material that lacked both enthusiasm and creativity. And now the guy's collaborated with Dublab's Frosty to schlep together a lazy, mindless and utterly tedious waste of plastic and good cover art titled <em>Dreams of Water Themes</em>. I don't know what to think anymore.</p>\n<p>If a song doesn't plan on having a compelling structure, the composer ought to attempt to make each moment of the song-- by variety, or some hook, or some curious sound-- compelling in its stead. Adventure Time seem to disregard their only responsibility to the listener, namely, to spare him of boredom. And this oversight is most obvious when their debut tracks reach their climax, as they often do, within the first thirty seconds of the song, then bask like half-wits for anywhere from three to four more minutes with nary an alteration. In effect, one could digest the entirety of <em>Dreams of Water Themes</em> in a few minutes simply by clicking through each track's opening sequences and moving on to the next; this summary includes the four run-of-the-mill speech samples comprise their own tracks and add nothing to the album, except as a reminder that, if you bought this album, you totally got ripped off.</p>\n<p>The bass, drum and bell groove of &quot;The Age of Aquariums&quot; is certainly promising, and nearly interesting upon a middle-eastern flute's entrance and the camp jazz vocal sample, but plateaus in energy and ideas. The Clouddead-meets-L.L. Cool J's &quot;Phenomenon&quot; novelty that is &quot;Whetting Whistles&quot; features the faux-intelligent wordsmithery of Pigeon John, who, whether he's being ironic or enacting a persona or doing whatever intelligent rappers think they're supposed to do, embarrasses himself with lines like, &quot;There's one thing I learned on the North Hills streets/ A man has to work if a man wants to eat.&quot; Final track, &quot;Rusty Anchors Wrestling Waves&quot;, wanders for seven minutes so aimlessly that one can only conclude it serves as the grab bag for all the samples that Daedelus and Frosty couldn't work into other tracks.</p>\n<p>&quot;Kappabashi&quot; is the only track on <em>Dreams of Water Themes</em> that doesn't suffer from a shameful paucity of ideas, and is actually quite good. Here, the duo cooks up a distinctly 60s Blue Note feel around a minor third piano progression reminiscent of John Coltrane's &quot;Giant Steps&quot; that eventually settles into a blues with a spatter of strangely echoed vibraphone samples. Children play in the background every so often, and an honest trumpet drone eventually sounds in concordance with gargled strings and piccolos.</p>\n<p>A rich and vibrant sound collage, &quot;Kappabashi&quot; not only comprised Adventure Time's most realized effort here, but also seemed to be the one in which both Daedelus and Frosty had much at stake emotionally. At the very least it's a tenderness that we know Daedelus is able to muster; hopefully this Adventure Time ship will dock for good.</p>\n",

Although the humble label (which houses each CD in a thin card case and whose CD face contains concentric circles as its main design motif) excels more in documenting an intimate scene of unassuming folks combining acoustic instrumentation with gentle washes of electronic processes, the closest parallel I could draw would be to the similarly grounded H\u00e4pna label out of Sweden.</p>\n<p>Aero is the double for label co-founder Koen Holtkamp and his own such explorations, and his latest release keeps with the modus operandi of the catalog to excellent effect. Fellow labelmate Brendon Anderegg helps open the disc with a hesitant bit of banjo plucking. The initial association might be to someone like The Books, but as the drone of the harmonium (or is it melodica?) swells and swallows up the sound in a dreamy gauze, there's little adherence to folk forms or tricky cut-editing, much less the shapes and sounds of the physical instrument itself. Instead, sonic distillation is Aero's intent; the warmth of each blended element and how it permeates the whole is the focus.</p>\n<p>Expanding out over the course of 11 minutes, &quot;Rises&quot; runs the twangs of Anderegg's guitar and what could be a pedal steel through the dream machine, so that they flicker past like a Kansas cornfield in the middle of a car nap. The drift of the track becomes blurry but remains snug as it morphs into &quot;Falls&quot;, with its more openly aired echoes that encase each bit of piano and guitar and give them more room to radiate.</p>\n<p>Velocity finally happens to the sputtering bits of &quot;Rinse&quot;, but as the increasingly unidentifiable sources are further reduced to abstract snaps, crackles and pops, we find ourselves plunked in the abstract spaces of &quot;Coast&quot;, aware that the borders between each five-lettered track name are mere indicators of where we might be in the disc itself. There is notable fuzz and ball of stylus fluff on &quot;Aug31&quot; and an embryonic fluidity to its neighboring &quot;Float&quot;, but they're slight alterations in a holistic entity, fluctuating ratios of sound and processing pressure. The traces of instrumentation gleaned at the start are further elucidated yet also freed from their encumbering sources as the disc moves along. Aero's alembic-like attentions to the greater project of brining in time is not content to just dissolve it all into an ambient puddle.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The pin drops inside a minimal techno clean room. A technician is there to hear it, and he captures the resulting tic on his unidirectional mic. The speck of sound spikes on a nearby monitor, and soon it's been tweaked and expanded like digitized grey matter silly putty, permuting beats and dot-matrix melodies into a new orchestral maneuver that bumps with quiet dignity from a dark and inviting future. Geoff White is versed in this pinprick aesthetic. Under his own name (for Force Inc., amongst others), he's produced quiet techno that shimmers like an echo in a subway tunnel, but is also stippled with the steely signature of sparks flown. Both rigid and poseable, his tracks are like robots with swivel-arm battle-grip.</p>\n<p>Debuting for Ghostly International as Aeroc, White leans back from that approach. Instead of wrapping plastic rhythms in expansive, fleecy melodies, <em>Viscous Solid</em> approaches glitch through the point of a guitar pick, and takes its time at the crests of its deep breaths. Whereas even minimal techno relies on a rhythmic framework, Aeroc dives headlong into doctored sounds without borders for restriction.</p>\n<p>Word on the street says a manipulated acoustic guitar was responsible for the majority of <em>Viscous Solid</em>. It's definitely a factor in opener &quot;My Love, The Wave Break&quot;, where repeated strums coast over consistently percussive smudges. The untreated acoustic adds welcome warmth to the track's more traditional underpinnings, giving it the quality of a hologram in the midst of a particularly leisurely daydream. A brief, windblown surge leads into &quot;Mahy&quot;, where that familiar ping-pong tickle travels parallel to the guitar's gentle ramble. Here, however, it's almost too far away from the foreground beat. Aeroc could be ruminating on the static effect of technology on organics, but he likely just got carried away with the echo pedal.</p>\n<p>Aeroc uncovers weight in the quietest of places. &quot;Fall First&quot; pits the hums of dueling industrial refrigerators against a downed power line's threatening pops and clicks; the result is a pulsing channel of eerie, creeping gloom. However, this song is also the corridor into <em>Viscous Solid</em>'s holding pattern center. &quot;Wish Eyes&quot; and &quot;Vio La&quot; drift into a tonal experimentalism that's effective, but somewhat banal next to tracks that blend their formless, swirling approach with subtle yet expressive rhythms. &quot;Enter&quot;'s layered bass tones ooze like black jelly, filling in the divots that line its backbone blips and cut-up acoustic chording. One of the album's strongest songs, &quot;Enter&quot; blends minimal techno's engaging, subtle rigidity with Aeroc's own penchant for six string-derived eclecticism.</p>\n<p><em>Viscous Solid</em> actually grows stronger as it moves along, even with the occasional stall in momentum. The sunny, layered guitars of &quot;Onward... Upward&quot; are almost unexpected when they finally arrive, but that doesn't prevent the track from conjuring images of a Zip drive named Gordon Lightfoot playing a concert for out-of-work CPUs. And emerald grass grows from between his microcircuits. &quot;Summer's Almost Over&quot; closes things out with its insistent, stuttering plinks and channel-shifting swells. Sticking around until its halfway mark brings a flurry of rangy acoustic snippets that surface trebly and flat, field recordings floating over what's become a multi-part rhythm when no one was watching. That's how, in its best moments, <em>Viscous Solid</em> is like plugging an electroencephalogram into the pickup of a Guild.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>For the past couple of years, Aeroplane have been the best kind of music geek secret. A pop-disco production duo from Belgium, Aeroplane have released a sporadic but endlessly enjoyable stream of singles, remixes, and collaborations since 2007. It was a bit heartbreaking when Vito De Luca and Stephen Fasano announced their breakup this summer; they cited artistic differences (De Luca will carry on as Aeroplane). <em>We Can't</em> <em>Fly</em> will make you believe those artistic differences were real. A schizophrenic and ultimately confused record, <em>We Can't Fly</em> abandons Aeroplane's airtight constructions for loose, haughty tracks that are as unclassifiable as they are messy.</p>\n<p><em>We Can't Fly</em> has the feel of a record that's to be everything to everybody-- hit receptacle, compendium of past works, exploration-- and as such ends up being nothing. There are splinters of excellence: the title track weaves an unexpectedly skankin' guitar part into gospel chants, big-rock piano bridges, and miles of keyboards. It's the antithesis of so many disco-as-savior anthems; you will nod and chant to our collective failure. &quot;Good Riddance&quot; and &quot;Without Lies&quot;-- a strange country amble and a sassy pop gem, respectively-- suggest the range and diversity of Ze Records (a clear influence), though &quot;Good Riddance&quot; mostly serves to remind that those Mutant Disco comps had some real clunkers.</p>\n<p>The misses miss big, and perplexingly. &quot;I Don't Feel&quot; splits the difference between <em>Guitar World</em> riffing and Patti LaBelle to disastrous effect. &quot;The Point of No Return&quot; auditions for <em>Top Gun</em> montages past and future; &quot;Fish in the Sky&quot; for Bowie's mid-90s blind spot. This from a band who had shown commendable restraint-- no wailing divas or 22-minute Kraut-funk jams; just tight,\u00a0languorous\u00a0bodyrock. It's not that these songs are gregarious, silly, and overstuffed-- we suspected Aeroplane had that in them-- it's that they are charmlessly so. &quot;I Don't Feel&quot; will fit most people's definitions of Bad Music, but more troubling is the existence of a giant, wailing barnburner that acts dressy and prim. Aeroplane aren't big personalities or great wits, so when they jostle and play it always feels like the joke's on us.</p>\n<p>Aeroplane seem to know a bit about artifice-- the serrated hook of &quot;Without Lies&quot; imagines a boring world without artists-- but <em>We Can't Fly</em> doesn't see them inhabiting unexpected personas or adopting new voices. It feels like fucking around, like a definitively non-definitive remnant of a partnership. <em>We Can't Fly</em>'s stylistic knuckleballs lack just about everything we'd grown to love about Aeroplane: namely luxurious grooves and effortless cool.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Remember the Mo' Wax aesthetic? I kind of miss it. Their early-to-mid-1990s vanguard of instrumental downtempo breakbeat peaked with DJ Shadow's <em>Endtroducing...</em> and, much like jazz fusion, their hip-hop fusion had a brief window of innovation followed by a period of watered-down stagnancy. But fond memories of <em>Headz</em> have a way of coming back to you, and the urge to listen to psych-prog noodling and ambient/illbient trip-out jazzbo riffs over heavy Class of '88 boom-bap breaks is going to need to get fulfilled sooner or later. And with Shadow gone halfway hyphy, RJD2 turned into a twee Stevie Wonder, and Diplo getting most of his artier tendencies out of his system with <em>Florida</em> over four years ago, that urge has gotten harder to sate as of late.</p>\n<p>This, then, should tide you over fine. Aether is one of several projects from San Antonio musician and graphic designer Diego Chavez, who has a couple of backup aliases (Otic Angst; A.M. Architect) in case one of the eight other groups out there operating under the name Aether sends a cease-and-desist. And within the first 13 minutes of <em>Artifacts</em>, his first full-length release as Aether, that familiar blunted vibe you might remember from those old UNKLE tracks you bumped 12 years ago comes creeping back in. Opener &quot;Forgive Me&quot; pulses its way into melancholy, electric piano-driven life like a wintry cousin to one-beat wonder Peter Panic's production on Jay-Z's &quot;Regrets&quot;, and subsequent sounds-- the head-nodding sparkle of &quot;Dejame Dormir&quot;, the stomping orchestral b-boy sweep of &quot;To Her&quot;, the combination of hard, skittering beats and aloof folk-pop on &quot;Anywhere&quot;-- reveal a simultaneous impulse towards percussive force and delicate, occasionally baroque melodic flourishes that give <em>Artifacts</em> a high-contrast personality.</p>\n<p>Those first 13 minutes, interestingly enough, comprise nearly a third of the entire album's length. <em>Artifacts</em> lacks the slow-build, long-drive sprawl of its mid-90s progenitors in favor of a more concise approach that shares a similar ear for the brief interlude-turned-song as Boards of Canada, moments which play out briefly between the margins of more extensive musical concepts. But while <em>Artifacts</em> throws its songs at you short and quick, they're all interlinked in an album-length ebb and flow that's smartly paced and meant to be a quickly shifting exercise in mood alteration. It's fitting enough that the only tracks that break the four-minute mark come at the album's midpoint peak (the disco-paced, borderline-Bollywood &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;) and the very end (&quot;Makeshift Sanctuary&quot;, which quotes lyrics from A Tribe Called Quest's &quot;Get a Hold&quot; over minimalist piano and maximalist drums).

                "en": "<p>The title of Africa Hitech's debut album, <em>93 Million Miles</em>,\u00a0refers to the distance between the Earth and the Sun, but it could just as well allude to the stylistic lengths spanned by the record itself, which dips its toes in everything from grime and juke to ambient field recordings and jazz. There's a danger when taking on a wealth of different, very clearly defined sounds that the result could sound like casual genre-hopping, or a lack of focus, but instead is extremely well paced and well crafted.</p>\n<p>It's no wonder: Africa Hitech are longtime electronic fixtures Mark Pritchard (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/KBMaBYE-Awo\">Global Communications</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzmawqmPX-E\">Harmonic 313</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deuqlcfEW6Y\">Steve Spacek</a>, two guys with the experience between them to make these sound clashes seem more fresh and edgy than merely reverent and knowing. That could come across as academic or chin-scratching, but thankfully above all there's an energy and vibrancy at the heart of <em>93 Million Miles</em> that evokes the feeling of two guys having a lot of fun exchanging ideas in the studio.</p>\n<p>Some of the most viscerally enjoyable moments come when the duo uses Chicago juke music as its platform. &quot;Out in the Streets&quot; uses a well-worn sample from Ini Kamoze's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpivgO3QFbo\">&quot;World-A-Music&quot;</a>, and bends it in and out of shape, chopping up the vocal and matching it to propulsive beats and pitched bass. Both the repetitive treatment of the hypnotic vocal and the 160 BPM beats are right in step with juke, but the sample choice and use of fifths lend it a dancehall feel.</p>\n<p>If the album title <em>93 Million Miles</em> were to be taken as a sort of conceptual journey toward the sun, then &quot;Spirit&quot; ushers in its final descent. The track is bathed in warmth, as gentle vocals and harmonies guide the song above the subtle ebb and flow of the rhythm-- a staple of UK funky music. It's one of the clearest indications of how the duo's technical expertise ensured that its conceptual approach turned out to be a conversation between styles rather than something more ungainly and forced.</p>\n<p>The final stretch of the album is also its strongest, taking in late-album highlights &quot;Light the Way&quot; and &quot;Cyclic Sun&quot;-- a pair of spectral tracks indebted to exploratory jazz; each also projects the same inviting warmth felt on &quot;Spirit&quot;. &quot;Light the Way&quot; uses forceful, live-sounding drums and pitched bass to wrap around a Sun Ra sample while &quot;Cyclic Sun&quot; jumps off from its title with revolving samples that weave around each other similarly to the way they tended to on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViItcZyYBw\">early Four Tet</a> productions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most impressive, considering the ground Africa Hitech cover on <em>93 Million Miles</em>, is how together the record sounds. An album taking in so many far-flung sounds could be forgiven for sounding disjointed-- and although the leaps are sometimes wild, it hangs together beautifully, sounding like a fully realized work with tracks that build on one another rather than rub against each other. It's no small feat to craft something this adventurous and eclectic and still have it turn out to share the cohesion of a DJ mix, but Africa Hitech manage just that-- and despite all the left turns, you want to stick by their side every step of the way.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Three songs into Africaine 808's debut album, over rippling drum machine and hand percussion, a British DJ named Alex Voice declares, &quot;Sound systems\u2014that's where it began.&quot; He's talking about the enormous stacks of speakers that have rocked the UK ever since they were imported from Jamaica in the 1950s, and his voiceover is part history lesson, part autobiography and part sermon. The title of the song, &quot;Language of the bass,&quot; comes from a refrain that he intones with the gravitas usually reserved for scripture, and true to form, the song's synthesized bassline writhes like a thing alive, its portamento glide and nimble syncopations as expressive as glyphs.</p>\n<p>But <em>Basar</em> isn't really a sound-system album; with the exception of &quot;Language of the Bass,&quot; UK dance culture barely figures. Instead, it's an album about hybridity, about the way that far-flung styles and sounds can make excellent dance partners. Refreshingly, there is nothing didactic about the German duo's approach. Rather than reprising established histories, Africaine 808 seem determined to devise their own narrative, one that reinvents the entire concept of &quot;world music&quot; from the ground up.</p>\n<p>This has been their way since the beginning. One of Africaine 808's early singles, &quot;Lagos, New York,&quot; built a bridge between Nigerian rhythms and New York disco, while &quot;Cosmicumbia&quot; linked cumbia, cosmic disco, and Afrobeat. <em>Basar</em> incorporates a host of disparate musical styles and conventions, but never in a tokenistic way: Instead, it's a joyful m\u00e9lange of sounds and rhythms, all underpinned by intricately programmed TR-808 patterns. In &quot;Ngoni,&quot; a West African string instrument provides the center of gravity for a rich, evolving array of rolling hand percussion, marimba, and fat, throbbing synthesizers. &quot;Crawfish Got Soul&quot; begins with the kind of jokey sample you might expect to find on <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em>\u2014a barking seal, a vintage recording of an MC exhorting people to loosen up and dance\u2014and quickly launches into a sprightly, Southern-fried mix of upright bass, blues guitar, horns, vibraphone, and Farfisa organs.</p>\n<p>Their hybrid approach is an extension of the DJ-friendly edits of African and Latin music that the duo's members, Dirk Leyers and DJ Nomad, have been making for their <a href=\"http://www.vulkandance.com/\">Vulkandance</a> parties for years. But <em>Basar</em> doesn't limit its perspective to the dancefloor: &quot;The Awakening,&quot; the album's opening track, deploys airy horns and strings in a way that's reminiscent of spiritual jazz, and the 808 doesn't even enter until halfway through the track. All of the album's songs tend to follow similarly serpentine arrangements, evolving as inscrutably and as naturally as the movements of a crowd. When they want to, they can also write flat-out beautiful songs: &quot;Ready for Something New&quot; is a tender tune featuring the vocals of the Israeli singer Ofri Brin, while &quot;Fallen From the Stars&quot; sounds like a melancholy response to Beanfield's great broken-beat ballad &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x17vp7_beanfield-the-season_music\">The Season</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>What really unifies the album is its deep sense of musicality. The album wouldn't be the same without the contributions of the Congolese/German percussionist Dodo N'Kishi, a longtime collaborator of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/\">Mouse on Mars</a>, and the Ghanian percussionist Eric Owusu, who has played with Ebo Taylor. On &quot;Language of the Bass,&quot; the interplay between bassline, squeaky synth lead, hi-hats, and myriad other accenting sounds amounts to a dazzling feat of syncopation. Despite that song's title and voiceover, what ultimately makes it sing isn't just its bassline, but how the pieces conjure the whole. With <em>Basar</em>, they have assembled a vast glossary of fresh sounds, considerably enriching the language of contemporary dance music in the process.</p>\n",

It's a playful admission that what African Head Charge was doing to dub, post-punk, Afrobeat, industrial, and world music might make more sense 10 years down the road.</p>\n<p>It's now 35 years later and\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/\">Adrian Sherwood</a>'s deconstruction of the music of Africa, Jamaica, and Great Britain might have finally found its proper decade and century.

Last year,\u00a0his\u00a0<a href=\"http://on-usound.com/\">On-U Sound</a>\u00a0imprint revived itself and began reissuing a wealth of material, from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20535-sherwood-at-the-controls-vol-1-1979-1984/\">a survey of Sherwood's decades of dub-punk productions</a> to the dizzying Trevor Jackson-curated\u00a0<em>Science Fiction Dancehall Classics</em>\u00a0comp. The music could have dated from 2015, no problem.</p>\n<p>Now comes the reissuing of the first four albums of his most heady and vital project, AHC. Taking issue with (or maybe just the piss out of)\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Eno</a>-<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/\">Byrne</a>'s fake ethnography\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/\"><em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</em></a>, Sherwood created a studio entity along the lines of Eno\u2019s oft-used quote for a &quot;vision of a psychedelic Africa.&quot; In much the same manner that\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/\">Fela</a>'s greatest bands had\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/\">Tony Allen</a>\u00a0set as the heart, AHC's pulse comes from African percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah, Sherwood\u2019s co-conspirator throughout AHC. And titling their debut album\u00a0<em>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</em>\u00a0was no euphemism, as Berry Street Studios, the space that Sherwood utilized for his early work, was below street level.</p>\n<p>Sherwood's work in UK punk and Jamaican expat dub is crucial to understanding post-punk of that era (around this same time, he produced\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/\">the Fall</a>\u00a0and many others), and he was at his finest in African Head Charge. The first album is by far the most experimental of the bunch. Take &quot;Elastic Dance,&quot; the opening track on\u00a0<em>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</em>. A jaw harp twangs and flanges, a sinewave wheezes up and down, a skittering and skeletal drum and bass pattern emerge. And then all of it gets bandied about the stereo field by Sherwood. Always stretching his components to the breaking point and finding rubbery new spaces between these elements, Sherwood used dub techniques to explore the outer regions of punk, reggae, Indian classical, belly dancer motifs, and more.</p>\n<p>And once you're this far beyond a certain genre's gravitational pull, Sherwood realized that these disparate forms could be melted back together into fucked-up shapes. Years later, &quot;Far Away Chant,&quot; featuring the vocals of thunder-throated Prince Far I, even appeared during a violent moment in David Lynch\u2019s\u00a0<em>Wild at Heart</em>. The emphasis on negative space is such that when\u00a0<em>Ground</em>\u00a0standout track &quot;Stebeni\u2019s Theme&quot; recently came on my ear buds during rush hour, the introduction of two percussionists on the train blended into that rubbery beat no problem.</p>\n<p><em>Environmental Studies</em>\u00a0appeared the next year and was also recorded underground, yielding a similarly claustrophobic, dank feel. More so than the first album,\u00a0<em>Studies</em>\u00a0scans as the nexus between free improvisation and dub reggae, less interested in melodic fragments and more about exploring the dark space between the two musical forms. The rotating assemblage of players included Jamaican session players like saxophonist &quot;Deadly&quot; Headley Bennett and drummer Style Scott, who was part of the riddim team that backed everyone from\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8438-gregory-isaacs/\">Gregory Isaacs</a>\u00a0to Black Uhuru, but it also made room for members of the Pop Group and Rip Rig + Panic, as well as UK free improviser Steve Beresford. &quot;Beriberi&quot; showcases a swinging horn line that\u2019s as close to ska as the virtual group ever got while &quot;Crocodile Hand Luggage&quot; pits Bonjo\u2019s nyabinghi drums against the sounds of running water and animal cries.</p>\n<p>By the time of\u00a0<em>Drastic Season</em>, their third album in as many years, Sherwood, Bonjo, and cohorts had moved above ground, setting up at Southern Studios and exploring the digital hardware the studio provided. By then, Sherwood had moved beyond the dub template and began to mince the sounds into ever-smaller pieces. The croak of an actual fish becomes the central element of &quot;I Want Water,&quot; as Sherwood drowns it in all sorts of severe, whiplashing effects. Even the smallest of musical gestures, such as the short bass figures and drum taps of &quot;African Hedge Hog,&quot; get amplified until they become labyrinths. At times, the tracks scan more as experiments.</p>\n<p><em>Off the Beaten Track</em>\u00a0struck the perfect balance between the mad professorial experiments of Sherwood and the crack live band that had Bonjo at the helm, but it also marked the end of the group for the next five years. The dub explorations hewed closer to the rhythms now, a sound that would soon be called &quot;ethno-beat&quot; and &quot;tribal.&quot; Didgeridoos and gypsy violins get turned into gnarly buzzes, African chants turn into incants, Prince Far I\u2019s chopped declamation mixes into Bonjo\u2019s big beat drums, and the barking dog of &quot;Some Bizarre&quot; is the most psychedelic canine until <a href=\"http://sfist.com/2016/01/26/guatemalan_insanity_pepper_vision_quest.php\">that \u2018shroom-chewing coyote</a>.</p>\n<p>Without as many heavy FX at Sherwood\u2019s mixing desk (but an uptick of Fairlight and Synclavier noises), the grooves come to the surface. Here\u2019s the clearest correlation from here to the early-'90s post-rock of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/\">Tortoise</a> and HiM, the spacy throbs perpetuated by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/\">the Orb</a>, and the illbient wooziness of WordSound\u2019s roster. &quot;Language becomes an instrument of reasoning in the true sense of the word,&quot; goes the chorus of &quot;Language &amp; Mentality,&quot; voiced by none other than Albert Einstein. While dealing with sounds over words, Sherwood\u2019s work across these early African Head Charge albums nevertheless increased the vernacular of adventurous producers in the decades ahead, sounding all the more resonant in the 21st\u00a0century.</p>\n",

Since then, the occasionally press-shy, always unpredictable artist has cranked himself up to a fever pitch, and there's no evidence that he's headed back to his hermitage any time soon.</p>\n<p>In the past year, we've been treated to a wealth of new, or at least new to us, music. First there was <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/\"><em>Syro</em></a>, Aphex Twin's triumphant return. Then, just four months later, came <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/\"><em>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</em></a>, an EP of more abstracted material, inspired by the intersection between robotics and acoustic instruments.\u00a0Right around the same time, James <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/648-if-this-aphex-twin-archive-is-fake-we-dont-want-to-know-what-real-is/\">launched a series of anonymous accounts on SoundCloud</a>, where he unloaded more than 100 previously unreleased tracks from his voluminous archives.</p>\n<p>If the title of the new release is to be believed, we're still in archival territory. (To that end, the cover art riffs on Warp's very first release, Forgemasters' <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Forgemasters-Track-With-No-Name/master/79596\">&quot;Track With No Name&quot;</a>, from 1989.) That the record is credited to AFX and not Aphex Twin is probably significant, although, as with all things related to James, there's room for interpretation. The AFX handle has come to mean different things at different periods: In the '90s, with the <em>Analogue Bubblebath</em> and <em>Hangable Autobulb</em> series, it meant rugged, percussive workouts with a touch of acid. For 2005's <em>Analord</em> series, it came to stand for lyrical, all-analog jams. <em>Orphaned Deejay Selek</em> is closer to <em>Analord</em> and provides a stark contrast to the labyrinthine twists of <em>Syro.</em> These songs soar with a burly kind of grace.</p>\n<p>But <em>Orphaned Deejay Selek</em> is no <em>Analord 12</em>. For one thing, many of the <em>Analord</em> releases sound positively lo-fi compared to the eight tracks here. The separation of the sounds in the mix, and the way they stake out a position in space, is nothing short of spellbinding.\u00a0 He's also not kidding about the &quot;deejay&quot; part of the title: These really are some of the most straightforward pieces of music that James has put his name to in years. They're far more focused on rhythm, on that ineffable quality known as the groove, than either of his other recent releases.</p>\n<p>James dives right in at 144 BPM on &quot;dmx acid test&quot; and doesn't let up, tearing through five tracks at the sort of tempos that haven't often been heard in techno since the '90s. &quot;acid test&quot; puts twin 303s through their paces while he lays down hissing, snapping electro rhythms; that track seamlessly gives way to &quot;oberheim blacet1b&quot;, a slightly more baroque variation on the same theme that gives free rein to his wild, microtonal tunings. &quot;simple slamming b 2&quot; is just what the title suggests, right down to the four-to-the-floor kick drums and rolling, 16th-note hi-hats.</p>\n<p>Towards the end he slows down. &quot;NEOTEKT72&quot; riffs on deliriously detuned synthesizers over a loosely funky beat, full of lanky tambourine and cowbell patterns; the closing &quot;r8m neotek beat&quot; recalls the spindly minimalism of 1994's <em>GAK</em> EP. The slowest track here might be the most surprising: &quot;midi pipe1c sds3time cube/klonedrm&quot; bumps away at 100 BPM, with wheezing synth-flutes and sad, sour bongo drums like some half-melted rainforest diorama in a gone-to-seed wax museum.</p>\n<p>But the keystone of the entire record is the one with the most understated title: &quot;bonus EMT beats&quot;. In DJ parlance &quot;bonus beats&quot; used to mean two- or three-minute filler cuts, often found on the B3 of a standard 12-inch EP, in which the A-side's beat, and maybe its bassline, was given a brief, stripped-down reprise. They were DJ tools, basically, meant to be juggled with. &quot;bonus EMT beats&quot; is clearly a rework of &quot;dmx acid test&quot;: it's got the same hard, dry snare thwack, the same staggered kick drum, the same ricocheting rimshots. The bassline's been muted and the reverb pushed way up. It rolls so naturally that it may take you a moment to notice what's changed: the bonus beat is in 5/4 time, whereas the original counts out in four. What's stunning is that James could take a cadence so unusual and make it feel so natural. For nearly five minutes, he wails away like a prog-rock titan on a drum throne. Usually, drum solos like this one make for an easy punchline, and you suspect that James may be teasing us here\u2014breaking it down, building it up, toying with the reverb, refusing us so much as a note of melody, self-indulgent to the max. And on and on it goes. Three records into his return, on the most Spartan cut of the bunch, James is sounding more energized than ever.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Late one night last week I happened by a co-worker listening to <em>I Care Because You Do</em> in his office. Hearing those tracks for the first time in years left me in a minor fit of nostalgia for the Aphex Twin persona circa 1995-- the impish playfulness, the eagerness to repulse, the self-mythologising and half truth-telling that kept him in the public eye, albeit at a comfortable remove.</p>\n<p>And it felt like ages ago, longer than a decade. Excepting <em>Rubber Johnny</em>, which was years in the making anyway, none of those descriptors have any relation to his current-day incarnation. Since the underrated <em>Drukqs</em> took a critical drubbing way back in 2001, Richard D. James has all but retired his visage from popular culture. In a far cry from his usual prolificacy, he has only the Analord vinyl series to show for his last five years. In a singles review somewhere I wrote that he's handled his elder statesman status in electronic music like a hoary old jazzman, receding deeper into himself and into his music with time. Compared to how inscrutable he is now, the Richard D. James of 1995 looked like Ryan Adams.</p>\n<p>Which is not to make it sound as if Analord is an insignificant accomplishment. A sequence of 11 different 12&quot; singles released under the AFX banner on James' Rephlex label starting in January 2005, they gave rise to his much-heralded return to hard IDM and acid techno, in the process selling in the five figure range, an incredible achievement for vinyl-- doubly so in the downloading era. Spawning more than 40 new tracks between them, the singles also helped to disabuse doubters of any notions that James had fallen into creative disrepair.</p>\n<p><em>Chosen Lords</em> not only marks the exclamation point on the project, it comprises James' first proper full-length record since <em>Drukqs</em>. While this is basically a sequenced highlights package picked from the Analord bounty, the accompanying press release insists it was the full-length James always intended to release. Even if everything here is already familiar to Analord watchers, it's a welcome return.</p>\n<p>Boasting 10 tracks and close to an hour of music, this comprises some of the busiest and most idea-packed music from the Analord set. Bookended by the insect electro of &quot;Fenix Funk 5&quot; and the sprawling jitterfunk of &quot;XMD 5a&quot;-- the two tracks that made up <em>Analord 10</em>, the first release in the series (don't ask)-- <em>Chosen Lords consists mainly of wobbly acid techno and dark, low-light IDM. There are a few pleasant diversions: &quot;Crying in Your Face&quot; is a solemn 303 ballad hinged around something approaching a vocoder, &quot;Boxing Day&quot; is a sparkling old school electro workout, and tantalizing album highlight &quot;PWSteal.Ldpinch.D&quot; surprises by introducing, of all things, a banging 4/4. But as with the rest of James' best work as AFX, there's a restless, fidgety quality to everything else here-- bursting with scampering rhythms and analog keyboard spasms, it's a deeply claustrophobic record overall.</em></p>\n<p>It's also masterfully arranged; James has refined his tangled, tangential compositional style down to a point. Much like a prog jazz record, it all sounds like a shambolic mess on first blush, but listen deeper and the individual parts start to assert themselves, not just in relation to the songs overall, but to each other. That labyrinthine style, along with James' regular palette of retro analog keys, combine to create a sound that is utterly sui generis and happily out of step with the overwhelming majority of techno in 2006. That he can quietly return with material this strong is pretty impressive indeed.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In a recent <em>Mojo</em> feature on Bob Dylan's 100 greatest songs, Frank Black talked about his attraction to &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;. What Black loves about the song above all are the drum fills at the end of each verse. This is where Black looks for the most powerful emotions on <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>, and he says that those fills can have him close to tears. Black's response popped out for me because the idea of &quot;emotional&quot; drumming resonates and yet you don't see mentioned often. Rare is the music where the percussion does this sort of lifting, but when it happens, the effect is striking.</p>\n<p>Richard D. James' single greatest talent may be his ability to program drums that convey feeling. He's always had a gift for melody and texture, obviously, but how these components work against his drums is what I'm always listening for. Which is, perhaps, why I've never much rated <em>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II</em>. To me it sounds like only half the Aphex Twin picture.</p>\n<p>In 1995, James' music was climbing along a Moore's Law curve, one release after the next filled with strange and adventurous sound that made the future of electronic music seem terribly exciting. In October, a few months after the release of <em>I Care Because You Do</em>, Warp put out two limited vinyl singles titled &quot;Hangable Auto Bulb&quot;. These 12-inches featured James' first experiments in pairing his unusual melodies with stuttering, chopped, jungle-influenced drum programming, which wound up defining his sound in the second half the 1990s. Both releases were limited and have been widely sought by collectors since; 10 years later Warp has released both together on CD.</p>\n<p>James was fond of percussion that didn't even pretend to sound like real drums. The spastic taps going through the title track sound like a pair of scissors banging on a metal desk, with no timbral body to speak of. But the failure to reference proper instruments (or even previous digital approximations) gives an extra squeeze of the &quot;alien&quot; quality noted by so many attempting to describe James' style. Then on &quot;Wabby Legs&quot; the drums are constantly sent into a roll so fast they are transformed into another kind of instrument, a highly tactile buzz that seems to breathe. When this sound duets with a real or imaginary thumb piano as the track comes to a close, another aesthetic plateau is reached and the music's place in time becomes fuzzy.</p>\n<p>&quot;Custodian Discount&quot; is the only track that makes obvious use of &quot;bass&quot; part of the drum'n'bass equation, with a huge balloon of low-end bouncing between the finely cut beats. In general James was too obsessed with balance to let the bass dominate. The swooning, half-sick synth lines that overlap on &quot;Laughable Butane Bob&quot; hint at the classical sensibility that would be tweaked and brightened on <em>The Richard D. James Album</em> the following year, while &quot;Every Day&quot; brings the tunefulness even further forward with a hypnotic distorted synth &quot;singing&quot; lead. Everything here is memorable and at eight tracks over 34 minutes <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> leaves you wanting more.</p>\n<p>Compared to how hectic James and others would get with the drill'n'bass template, <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> is very restrained-- serene, even-- despite beats that can never stop twitching. The drums throughout seem strangely alive, full of energy but fallible, ready to take off at the slightest provocation. That tension, between the otherworldly yet effortlessly tuneful melodies purring along beneath drums that constantly struggle to frame them, is what the ensuing era of James' music is all about, and <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> is a hell of an intro.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Now 11 records into what was expected to be a 10-platter set, even the most fervent Richard D. James worshippers might be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed, bored, or apathetic by the <em>Analord</em> series. While the results have proved intermittently brilliant, only occasionally dull, and generally better than 2001 faith-shaker <em>Drukqs</em>, no one seems to agree what's what. There may be a hidden master plan yet, but the master sure seems to be coasting.</p>\n<p>With the release of his latest triad, James has reached a (temporary?) stopping point. <em>Analord 10</em> actually came first last December, but it's been re-issued as a logo-bearing picture disc, and what does order matter when the man's latest sounds like his earliest? Each of the <em>Analord</em> releases adopts the AFX moniker, analogue synth sounds and even inscrutable titles he used in his early '90s <em>Analogue Bubblebath</em> acid-house recordings. (Except the original 10th, i.e. first, which was released as Aphex Twin. Got it?)</p>\n<p><em>Analord 10</em> remains the best of the new EPs so far. It's not hard to see why listeners who'd already dished out 40 quid for this record might have gone on to order the collection's later, less-inspiring discs. A-side &quot;Fenix Funk 5&quot; alternately buzzes and reclines, incorporating garbled, vocoder-like noises, and gently descending chimes along with energetic drum machines. The dense, dark seven-plus minutes of bell-tolling B-side &quot;Xmd5a&quot;, still more melodic than most acid but playing hard to get, make it probably the series' best track. OK, some consensus, then.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Analord 11</em> is colder, sadder, and less satisfying. Its two tracks, like those on the eighth and ninth outings, are named after viruses and spyware. A-side &quot;W32.Mydoom.Au@mm&quot; whines and moans over steady handclaps and padded cymbals like an electronic plea for help-- whether with musical ideas or personal life, it's far from clear. On the flip, &quot;Backdoor.Ranky.S&quot; layers drooping synths over a steady boom-pah rhythm, squelching lazily and unnecessarily toward the upper registers as the tune fizzles out. <em>Analord 9</em>-- comprising four tracks rather than the nine fakes originally leaked to file-sharing networks-- ups the BPMs, with skittering hi-hats galore. Bouncy &quot;Backdoor.Netshow&quot; is the highlight, panning left and right as a scratchy sawtooth eventually joins, then drowns in effects.</p>\n<p>As many of you know, James is far from the only electronic artist going back to the Phuture-- a full-fledged acid revival has been going on for a while now, exemplified by the likes of Luke Vibert, Atom Heart, and a series of inevitable mostly welcome compilations-- but his following expects him to do more than just partake in the latest craze. According to pernicious rumor, dozens more <em>Analord</em> tracks are in the vault.What else has James got up his sleeve? What does it all mean? WWRDJD? No epiphanies here, but the canny bastard keeps us hanging on.</p>\n",

The Aphex Twin mastermind's first project since 2001's perplexing <em>Drukqs</em> started promisingly enough, albeit expensively, with the 40 quid <em>Analord 10</em> last December. However, subsequent offerings in this procession of 12-inches have raised disconcerting questions: Why is one of the 90s most enduring electronic musicians splitting so much time between 80s electro and the sound of his own early-career <em>Analogue Bubblebath</em> efforts? Is he washed up, or just acid-washed? Taking us to the cleaners?</p>\n<p>As of the sixth, seventh, and eight <em>Analord</em> installments, James seems more TB-303 now than man, twisted and primeval. These insistent, repetitive analogue compositions are almost perversely anachronistic, a robot curled up in the fetal position rather than the conqueror of new colonies we'd once come to expect. The multi-layered beats of <em>Drukqs</em> persist, but the glistening melodies that set apart the Twin's finest work are, after burbling just beneath the surface of some early <em>Analord</em> tracks, all too infrequent in this batch.</p>\n<p>Much of <em>Analord 6</em> will be familiar to anyone who's heard its predecessors. &quot;Batine Acid&quot; plies rote acid lines with intermittent spookiness, &quot;Snivel Chew&quot; adds sawtooth synths and rapid handclaps, and &quot;2 Analogue Talks&quot; at least mixes things up with squeaky, high-pitched scales giving way to the monotonous, clock-like donging of what sounds like a horn sample. Standout &quot;I'm Self Employed&quot; suggests that whatever James is up to, he's not just going through the motions-- at least not always. Fragile, lonely melodies and countermelodies reminiscent of his ambient works build into a rust-eyed chorus and actually take it somewhere.</p>\n<p><em>Analord 7</em> kicks off with the (deceptively?) straightforward acid-house of &quot;Lisbon Acid&quot;, which bloops, thumps, fuzzes, squelches, and ultimately meanders for an entire side. The echoey off-key synths of &quot;Pitcard&quot; start and stop on a dime, which is better than a nickel (worth more, too!). The &quot;AFX Acid 04&quot; evokes almost an acid remix of Spoon's &quot;I Turn My Camera On&quot; with its slinky changes and martial pace, before giving way to ominously discordant skarronking.</p>\n<p>The tracks on <em>Analord 8</em> are named for computer viruses, likely in an effort to discourage file-sharers. Then again, the pieces might have been so named because a few are among the series' most infectious so far. Awash in disco hi-hats, &quot;PWSteal.Ldpinch.D&quot; beckons with the type of decidedly non-digital lust, come-hither bass line, and slightly detuned hooks that a Kylie Minogue could have taken upchart. Blippy &quot;W32.Deadcode.A&quot; is almost as good once the bridge arrives like a between-storms rainbow. &quot;Backdoor.Berbew.Q&quot;, meanwhile, rises and subsides with a burbling bass and choir-like synth chords, and &quot;Backdoor.Spyboter.A&quot; unfolds similarly over pings and more handclaps, but neither really goes anywhere. That's the disappointing crux of James's current collection of never-awful but rarely remarkable noodlings.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A few more books in Richard James' series on the Well-Tempered TB-303. The first two installments weren't bad and there was something exciting in knowing that new material from James' hit the shelf. But the self-imposed restrictions of the Analord project (analog synths used to craft vintage-sounding Analogue Bubblebath-style tracks) are narrow, and the music never takes risks or veers in an unexpected direction. The first two volumes were comforting and pleasant but little else.</p>\n<p>The same limitations hold for <em>Analord 3-5</em> and there are still few surprises, but on balance these releases are more exciting. <em>Analord 3</em> is particularly strong, beginning with &quot;Boxing Day&quot;, which places a John Carpenter/Gershon Kingsley spooky Moog melody on top of a thrusting electro beat. The various elements are in constant movement in and around each other, and &quot;Boxing Day&quot; is busy and energetic even if it never exactly goes anywhere. &quot;Midievil Rave 1&quot; is all heavy ugliness, with dissonant and out-of tune sequences and some herky-jerky stop/start action that allows me to picture James riding the fader from all the way across the ocean. And &quot;Klopjob&quot;, with simple yet funky drum programming and a lovely pastoral melody, is perhaps the best single track in the series so far.</p>\n<p><em>Analord 4</em> is comparatively spare and almost as good. The bouncy &quot;Crying in Your Face&quot; has what could be some heavily vocodered vocals (or James could be he's just making the machines talk) and a strong pop feel, while the quiet, menacing &quot;Home Made Polysynth&quot; gets same mileage from between-note beats in the manner of <em>Analord 3</em>'s &quot;Midievil Rave 1&quot;. The closing &quot;Breath March&quot; is a deceptively great tune. On the one hand it's quiet, with almost nothing happening in the midrange, but the power of the fathoms-deep bass hook could easily be missed without proper playback equipment.</p>\n<p>There's not much to recommend on the two-track fifth volume. The peppy &quot;Reunion 2&quot; has a wickedly squelching acid line that creates its own light trails, and the stiff &quot;Cilonen&quot; is by-the-numbers Detroit electro, sounding a bit like Drexciya without the mystery. At the halfway point the conservatism of James' approach is the most notable thing about the <em>Analord series. He's a gifted composer who excels at this style but anyone who has followed his music closely can't help but expect more.</em></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>At some point in the mid-90s, Richard D. James transformed from an inconsistent but frequently mindblowing producer of electronic music into his scene's icon. As the interested came to know him, the man behind the Aphex Twin was a half-cracked mastermind who, unlike most out-there eccentrics in pop music mythology, managed to have the world by the balls. He sold his tracks to advertisements, bragged about shagging his French girlfriend, remixed for cash, and had modern music giants like Philip Glass ringing up his apartment/bank vault to arrange collaborations. Not that he could hear the phone-- he was too busy tooling around the countryside in his tank.</p>\n<p>Through all the craziness, James still found a way to channel the sound he heard in his head into records, at least one of which every listener seems to love. With his fascinating and often conveniently unverifiable backstory, he was a music critic's dream, sliding easily into deeply cut grooves where the genius is always young and the talent is irrepressible.</p>\n<p>One component of his legend has worked strongly in James' favor, particularly in the latter years: Because his childlike antics suggested he'd do anything for a laff, his work always contains at least one &quot;just kidding&quot; link in its DNA strand. So if a track sucked, it was, by default, because James was either lazy or having some fun-- not because he couldn't do better if he wanted to. After all, he has hundreds of brilliant tracks socked away somewhere that he can't be bothered to release. Why would he deliberately put out something that was just OK?</p>\n<p>Why, indeed? People wondered what James was up to after the 2001 release <em>Drukqs</em>, and there was some speculation that it was a contract fulfillment a la Prince's <em>The Vault/Old Friends 4 Sale</em>. It wasn't that <em>Drukqs</em> was bad, exactly, just that it seemed uninterested in breaking new ground, which was unusual considering the bold strokes to which the Aphex Twin audience had grown accustomed. James still did Aphex Twin better than anyone, but after his prolific 90s, that was no longer enough. Now, four quiet years later, he returns with a new series of 12-inches, dusting off his old <em>Analogue Bubblebath</em> handle AFX in honor of the vintage synths used to craft the Analord material. The records will be issued in 10 volumes, to be housed in a binder sold with the set.</p>\n<p>The key word for <em>Analord</em> is &quot;acid.&quot; James has the archetypal gurgly 303 working overtime throughout, crunching out the melody on the upbeat &quot;Where's Your Girlfriend?&quot;, letting the layered tendrils of squelch crawl over each other like a pit of electric-powered snakes in the mid-track breakdown. The bouncier &quot;Grumpy Acid&quot; fulfils the promise of its excellent title by sounding like the amplified gastric system of a robot badly in need of Pepto Bismol. &quot;Steppingfilter 101&quot; is mid-tempo mellow, with gentle synth pads floating behind the zig-zag buzz out front. It's a seriously retro sound, channeling precisely one offshoot of early &quot;classic&quot; IDM. If an unknown had released the tracks on <em>Analord 1</em> in 1995, he would have been accused of straight ripping the AFX acid style. But James pioneered this sound, so I guess he has the right to return to it if he chooses.</p>\n<p><em>Analord 2</em> is a little better, keeping the same palate while toning down the tired acid textures and delivering more melody. The tuneful &quot;Phonatacid&quot; isn't exactly riveting, but it does manage to undergo some interesting transformations over its nearly 10-minute length. &quot;Laricheard&quot; references the famed Chicago house pioneer Larry Heard in its title but is the most drifting and contemplative track here. It all sounds nice enough, but no one introduced to James with these tracks would be compelled to investigate further.</p>\n<p>It's possible that as additional volumes of <em>Analord</em> are issued, these initial records will make sense in the larger context. Perhaps this is the <em>Back to the Future</em> phase of the project, where James revisits where he's been with AFX before taking us somewhere new. More than anything it's difficult to believe that the hyperactive and easily bored James could have kept himself entertained working on these pieces, which boldly go where so many (most notably the man himself) have gone before.</p>\n",

Kristian Emdal and Simon Formann were both members of the now-defunct post-punk band <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/\">Lower</a>, and their proximity to punk and noise is tangible on\u00a0<em>Performance</em>, their second full-length, which echoes the intense, bleak temperaments of the bands who have come to define that scene. While the release\u2019s best moments are intricate and beat-driven, its dominant mode seems located more in its interludes of thinly-built, staticky unease. Taken as a whole, these stops and starts can feel less intentionally unsteady and more flat-out inconsistent.</p>\n<p>In terms of cultivating a mood,\u00a0*Performance\u00a0*starts on a high note. Opener \u201cEsprit\u201d\u2019s rumbling bass crawls into focus, low-end slowly receding to highlight a single tinny beat. It\u2019s dread-inducing, but also engaging and concise. The lead single \u201cRaptor,\u201d far and away the release\u2019s standout track, follows in this vein: its staccato rhythm is tempered with broad, wavering strokes of melody, creating a rare sense of breathing room. It\u2019s reminiscent of textured, Modern Love-style ambient techno, like a softer-edged <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/\">Demdike Stare</a>.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, things turn more abstract, and more claustrophobic. \u201cDamp\u201d\u2019s horror-film textures ruminate for a few minutes before opening into cold, insistent percussion, never quite boiling over into true noise. \u201cProtein\u201d is similarly soaked in chilling atmospherics, structured around an anxious, fragmentary jungle beat. In a jarring change of pace, \u201cDomestic I\u201d and \u201cDomestic II\u201d dispense with beats altogether, instead overlaying a persistent buzz and clatter with mournful instrumentation: on \u201cI,\u201d a cello met with whining harmonies, and on \u201cII,\u201d a pretty, rickety piano solo.\u00a0They\u2019re not unattractive compositions, but for the time they take up on this otherwise fairly brief release, these interludes don\u2019t feel particularly well-integrated or useful.</p>\n<p>Moments of\u00a0<em>Performance</em>\u00a0offer\u00a0welcome glimpses of something more complex than their once-stated mission to evoke\u00a0\u201cfeeling really low in a corner of the club.\u201d \u201cRaptor\u201d gives a particularly danceable example of this forward movement, but more fearsome moments like closer \u201cHeadron\u201d are also promising. At their best, Age Coin synthesize the ambient and industrial mood-building of their past and concurrent projects with the physicality of techno, inducing anxiety through the occasional application of a frenetic texture. A more exciting approach might\u00a0dispense with the instrumental experiments and embrace this path full-on.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A sample of Antye Greie's prior collaborators, including Ellen Allien and Vladislav Delay, gives you a good sense of her approach. She sweeps out the dark corners of electronic music, reclaiming whatever scraps of sonic information slip free from the nets of genres. These splinters of melody, bits of noise, subliminal streaks of rhythm, and bewildered voices are compressed into a nebulous whole. Volume is more important than harmony. Greie often operates somewhere beyond music, probing into sculpture, science, and math.</p>\n<p>Greie's sixth solo album as AGF, <em>Einzelk\u00e4mpfer</em>, is a mix of spoken-word, singing, low-key noise, and the occasional distended rhythm. Rather than building, her tracks keep flexing and doubling back. Some verifiable songs slip out of the haze: The title track, though it begins in a dripping tunnel of beats and warbles, emerges into something like dehydrated Fever Ray. And &quot;Worin mein Mund Zur Bewegung Fand&quot; sounds like Alison Goldfrapp singing in a junkyard where someone happens to be playing a Morton Feldman record at half speed.</p>\n<p>But more often the music is just a receptacle for fantastic shapes and incongruous images. On the beautifully designed &quot;We Break Out&quot;, with clip-clopping drums and a synth tone that keeps popping out like a broken spring, anxiously pitch-shifting vocal harmonies run alongside a calm recitation. It's a motif that repeats across the album. Greie keeps splitting into two beings, one impassive and the other freaked out, talking over each other. It's like those Beach Boys songs where the backing vocals contradict all the exhortations to have fun, but elevated to full-bore\u00a0dissociative\u00a0identity disorder.</p>\n<p>&quot;You invented language,&quot; Greie confides conspiratorially on &quot;Alone in the Woods (The Fox, the Skunk and the Rabbit)&quot;, but <em>Einzelk\u00e4mpfer</em> takes up the concept of the &quot;lone warrior,&quot; (the word's English meaning) so of course, she's talking to herself. Before translating the German, you might gather that her dry, tart delivery represents what she intends to say, while its distressed twin is what the listener hears. It's challenging to box what we mean in language, and to ensure that the contents don't shift in transit. But the problem turns out to be simpler than that-- there simply isn't anyone to talk to. On &quot;Practicing Beat Anarchy&quot;, she sounds out the words of the title roughly, as if trying to force some meaning into them. It's a solitary war of attrition. By closing track &quot;On Earth&quot;, every trace of the communicative has vanished into a primordial ooze of voiceless low frequencies. After all the torturous expression, this arrives as an almost physical relief.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>For many years, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/\">Air</a>\u2019s clever hybrid of downbeat electronic, 1960s pop, and Gallic kitsch served as a gateway to undiscovered worlds of cool. They brought their cachet to artists long out of fashion: the leather-voiced <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/\">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, the antic electronic experimenters <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22300-perrey-kingsley/\">Perrey and Kingsley</a>, the easy-listening maestro <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/\">Burt Bacharach</a>, the mellifluous synth wizard Tomita. Long before yacht-rock made lite acceptable, Air spun effortless good taste into a form as frothy, weightless, and melt-on-your-tongue easy to consume as meringue.</p>\n<p>However, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel are more than just hip foreign exchange students who lived with you in high school and left behind a bunch of really cool CD-Rs. Over the course of their two-decade career, the French duo expanded their dandelion-tuft pop sound across nine albums\u2014among them groundbreaking film scores, Italian spoken-word collaborations, and, last year, a vinyl-only soundtrack to a museum exhibition. Still, in 2016, does anyone need a greatest-hits release from them\u2014especially when you can sequence your favorites on the streaming services that have now replaced them as gateways to the obscure?</p>\n<p>Even for those who answer \u201cyes,\u201d it's doubtful that <em>Twentyears,</em> the French duo\u2019s first best-of and rarities collection, will be the one to satisfy. Diehard fans and more unfamiliar listeners alike will likely find its tracklist obvious, as it draws heavily from the band\u2019s early material; if you really wanted to hear half of their debut, <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11442-moon-safari-10th-anniversary-edition/\">Moon Safari</a>**,</em> wouldn\u2019t you just listen to it? The best-of disc includes five songs from <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/81-talkie-walkie/\">Talkie Walkie</a></em>, two from <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/\">10,000 Hz Legend</a></em>, and then just one apiece from <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/74-the-virgin-suicides/\">The Virgin Suicides</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9975-pocket-symphony/\">Pocket Symphony</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16255-le-voyage-dans-la-lune/\">Le Voyage Dans la Lune</a></em>. Consider this: 13 of the best-of disc\u2019s 17 selections appear in Apple Music\u2019s ranking of the duo's most popular songs.</p>\n<p>The first eight tracks on the disc include \u201cLa Femme D'Argent,\u201d \u201cCherry Blossom Girl,\u201d \u201cPlayground Love,\u201d and \u201cSexy Boy\u201d\u2014songs you've probably heard so many times, you scarcely even register them as they\u2019re playing. The first half of the disc lulls you into such a stupor of viscous strings, vibraphone, soft-porn jazz flute, and similarly syrupy ingredients, poured on in motions as familiar as your own bleary-eyed matinal rituals, that you barely even notice when track nine, \u201cMoon Fever\u201d\u2014from 2012\u2019s <em>Le Voyage Dans la Lune</em>, and probably the first song here you haven\u2019t heard more times than you can count\u2014cuts through the daze with its otherworldly, breathtakingly spooky beauty.</p>\n<p>But then that's followed by back-to-back songs from <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em>\u2014the mouth harp and motorik chug of \u201cDon't Be Light\u201d (Air does <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/\">Suicide</a>, essentially), followed by the gossamer gospel of \u201cHow Does It Make You Feel\u201d (Air does <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/\">Spiritualized</a>?)\u2014and you\u2019re reminded that you\u2019re listening to a playlist, not an album. \u201cOnce Upon a Time,\u201d\u00a0*Pocket Symphony\u2019*s piano-driven echo of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/\">Stereolab</a>, is a lovely tune. Then there are some more songs from <em>Talkie Walkie</em> and <em>Moon Safari</em>, just in case you'd forgotten those albums exist. Only by the penultimate track are we treated to a non-LP cut, \u201cLe Soleil Est Pr\u00e8s de Moi,\u201d a slow drip of narcotic R&amp;B that harkens back to their early connections to Mo Wax.</p>\n<p>As for the rarities disc, three of its songs were already released on the <em>Moon Safari</em> tenth anniversary edition in 2008. Two more come from 2009's *<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/\">Love 2</a>**\u2014*a release that doesn\u2019t figure at all into the best-of disc\u2014while another is from *Love 2\u2019*s Japanese edition. (That one\u2019s called \u201cIndian Summer\u201d\u2014do you even need me to tell you it\u2019s got a sitar in it?) \u201cHigh Point\u201d is just an instrumental version of \u201cOnce Upon a Time.\u201d Fortunately, there are a few nice surprises, even if six of the \u201crarities\u201d are songs fans have heard before. The <em>Pocket Symphony</em> bonus cut \u201cThe Duelist,\u201d a breathy, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/\">Bowie</a>-referencing duet between <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4921-charlotte-gainsbourg/\">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/\">Jarvis Cocker</a>, is great, with a quirky melodic drift that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on one of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/9328-cate-le-bon/\">Cate Le Bon</a>\u2019s albums. The previously unreleased \u201cAdis Abebah,\u201d from the soundtrack to 2010\u2019s <em>Quartier Lointain</em>, folds Ethio-jazz saxophones into Air\u2019s velvety downbeat, to winsome effect. And the hushed, deadpan \u201cThe Way You Look Tonight\u201d plays to their strengths as masters of style over substance: \u201cI like the way you look tonight/No blood in your vein, what does it mean/Trashy art everywhere, on the screen/Slow-motion aftertaste, and love at first sight.\u201d It\u2019s seductive and ridiculous all at once.</p>\n<p>But that's the rare instance on <em>Twentyears</em> where the band's ambitions are given their due. Where are the odd, wonky pop songs like \u201cMissing the Light of the Day,\u201d from <em>Love 2</em>? Or the bristling electronic textures of <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em>? They hint at a more exciting compilation that might have been by including\u00a0\u201cLand Me,\u201d a gorgeous, meditative sketch off last year\u2019s unexpected <em>Music for Museum</em>, a minimalist ambient soundtrack for an art exhibition? Why not include more of that? Or, instead of a superfluous best-of collection, why not reissue the vinyl-only <em>Music for Museum</em>, which is currently selling for $130 and up on Discogs? Air have never been the most adventurous of bands, but as <em>Music for Museum</em> proved, they\u2019re not afraid to experiment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the picture that emerges on <em>Twentyears</em> is a simplified version of Air that swaps out most of their quirks for only their most palatable qualities. It\u2019s a lite version of the band, and a frustrating missed opportunity.</p>\n",

The impeccably shaved-down prog tendencies of &quot;How Does It Make You Feel?&quot; from <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/\">10,000 Hz Legend</a></em> shows how effective it can be to take the wilder whims of a genre and thoroughly de-clutter them.</p>\n<p>That sense of nonchalance, executed with total control, has long been Air's M.O. It's a kind of stoicism shared with artists like Ron Mael of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4152-sparks/\">Sparks</a> and Chris Lowe of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/\">Pet Shop Boys</a>.-- a rigid, and admirable, commitment to a singular strain of projected being. When <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/\">Portishead</a> became a coffee-table favorite, they disappeared for years, overhauling their sound with the jagged lines of <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third/\">Third</a></em>. Air went in the other direction. They were too locked-down in the detached journey they were committed to, resulting in bland and dispassionate albums like 2009's <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/\">Love 2</a></em>. This record, a soundtrack to the restored, hand-colored version of the classic Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s silent film <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000417/\">Le Voyage Dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon)</a>,</em> is a diversion of sorts. It offers Air a chance to bring some of the artistry back into their music, to work at rediscovering the elegance within the sleek surface drift they often lackadaisically flop into.</p>\n<p><em>Le Voyage Dans la Lune</em> is less light than its predecessor. There's a brawny thickness to the guitar line in &quot;Astronomic Club&quot;, a spine-tickling ghostliness passing through &quot;D\u00e9collage&quot;, a pile-up of electronics marching with resolve on &quot;Sonic Armada&quot;. It's never less studied than Dunckel and Godin's prior work, but it feels like M\u00e9li\u00e8s' imagery may have inspired them to rediscover the playful side of their personalities-- the side that once prompted them to release a remix album titled <em>Everybody Hertz</em>. By the time they got to <em>Love 2</em>, the understated joy of songs like &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars&quot; had all but vanished, replaced by vapid and overly serious stodge like &quot;So Light Is Her Footfall&quot;.</p>\n<p>After coasting in half-realized bliss for so long, Dunckel and Godin appear to be reaching into the past in order to go forward. In the <em>5-10-15-20</em> interview, Godin talks about the curse of making &quot;shit records&quot; after you turn 40. Here, his coping mechanism for that, on a handful of tracks, at least, is to pluck a few ideas from the playful Air on prior records. &quot;Parade&quot; is all bright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Kingsland\">Paddy Kingsland</a>-inspired analog synth bursts, chirping birdsong, and ruptured drum parts that bring the track to a stuttering halt. But it's a retrogressive step, something this band has done before but better, fuller, and with a greater sense of direction. Here, it feels like a pleasant yet unremarkable switch back to the past, the sound of Air staring into a half-empty well of ideas, on the verge of becoming their own tribute band.</p>\n<p>It's a shame, because the collaboration with Victoria Legrand of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/\">Beach House</a> on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/44827-listen-to-airs-collaboration-with-beach-houses-victoria-legrand-seven-stars/\">&quot;Seven Stars&quot;</a> seemed to bode well for this album. The percussion-heavy frame provides the edge that prevents the softer intonations from becoming too fluffy. There's a marrying of militaristic thrust, snug vocal cooing, and a gloriously silly spoken-word countdown halfway through. For a minute it feels as if there are a few cracks in the veneer, which is generally the space from which all the best Air material's gathered. When they lower their guard and open their music up to unexpected elements, it causes the professorial approach to melt away. It makes sense that Dunckel was a mathematics teacher. Air's songs often sound like formulas spread out upon a page, with its makers puzzling over them, trying to figure out why they don't quite add up.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <em>Le Voyage Dans la Lune</em> is an unsteady mixture of partially inspired notions reaching for a purpose. It's a bountiful collection of loose ideas, hanging in the breeze without forging forward in any meaningful direction. &quot;Who Am I Now?&quot; is representative of the problem, with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4822-au-revoir-simone/\">Au Revoir Simone</a> providing nebulous vocals that touch on the kind of spectral folk the <a href=\"http://ghostbox.co.uk/\">Ghost Box</a> label so effectively delivers. But this feels like a facsimile of that work, and a poorly made one at that. It's too calculated, too studious. It's music reduced down to its raw components with all the mystery torn out. There are parts of the record that get back to the potential this band once possessed-- a slight return to interlacing all the best parts of Moog demonstration records, hoary old prog moves, and extravagantly deluxe production techniques. But back then they made it seem so easy. Here, it feels like they're trying too hard.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>There are a few things I'm impressed with Air for doing: resuscitating crusty, decades-old Moog blorps amidst the frenzy of millennial techno-utopian futurism, turning a new generation on to a certain vintage Gallic notion of jet-set sophistication, and getting indie- and punk-dominated college rock stations to play what essentially amounted to lounge prog. Most of all, there's the way they composed their music as an unapologetically frothy sort of cheese-pop without letting it get dominated by snorting insincerity or self-conscious hokeyness. You could still hear the kitsch, but it wasn't the driving force, and they had a sneaky way of lulling you into forgetting you weren't &quot;supposed&quot; to like this kind of thing. Hell, lots of people actually had sex to <em>Moon Safari</em>, which is about as unironic as you can get. (At least I hope they were being unironic.)</p>\n<p>A half-decade of Balearic/glo-fi/'lude-house has since refined that mellow aesthetic to the point where taste-conscious end-runs around potential irony have become increasingly unnecessary. But while that refinement applied readily to the subtle songcraft of <em>Talkie Walkie</em> and <em>Pocket Symphony</em>, both of which provided ample evidence of Air's vintage pop smarts, they've somehow stumbled their way into a pit of lite-FM treacle on their new album. <em>Love 2</em>-- as titles go, a bad pun disguised as a sequel nobody needed-- is a dopey little slice of not-much that feels like a noodly rendering of yacht-pop weightlessness. Much has been made about Air's new independence in the process of making this album; it's the first one to come out of their new recording studio, Atlas, and the first to be written and recorded without the input of any major outside producers (though they still brought in <em>Moon Safari</em> engineer Stephane &quot;Alf&quot; Briat to tinker behind the boards). Far be it from me to accuse Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel and Nicolas Godin of being a couple empty vessels who need a Nigel Godrich to whip them into shape, but maybe they could've used someone looking over their shoulders to warn them away from indulging in some bad ideas.</p>\n<p>Bad ideas like, say, &quot;Tropical Disease&quot;. This song is the album's longest, worst, and most emblematic of <em>Love 2</em>'s problems, nearly seven minutes of malaise that bookends a preciously chipper, tin whistle-punctuated slab of Playskool krautrock with two movements of plastic surgeon's waiting-office Muzak. It's laughably oily when its Econolodge-noir sax oozes in crotch-first, and even more uncomfortable in its second half when Dunckel's pitched-up voice chirps, &quot;Woman/ Make me feel... <em>warm inside</em>.&quot; God, it's awkward. That empty yet still uncomfortable theme of louche, inarticulate romance is all over the record's ill-advised vocal tracks: pining over a walking (albeit <em>softly</em> walking) clich\u00e9 in &quot;So Light Is Her Footfall&quot;; trying to milk intrigue out of the lifeless phrase, &quot;there is something going on between us,&quot; in &quot;You Can Tell It to Everybody&quot;; murmuring about love in &quot;Love&quot; (lyrics: &quot;Love/ Love/ Love/ Love/ Love&quot;). The lyrics read less like the work of someone who didn't grow up speaking English than someone who knows it well and thinks it's kind of a stupid, pointless language. That'd explain the empty, tense-based babble-talk in &quot;Sing Sang Sung&quot;, at least.</p>\n<p>Maybe they've always been perpetrators of petty crimes against lyrical songwriting and it's only now that their music's been weak enough to avoid hiding it. The exoticism that made their instantly recognizable brand of music compelling-- the outmoded technology, the unexpected world-music left turns, the almost detached baroqueness-- has been diluted to the point where all their old tricks sound listless. Leadoff track &quot;Do the Joy&quot; is maybe the least-botched attempt at doing something new, though its fuzzed-out slo-motion strut is quickly rendered absurd by a &quot;spooky&quot; B-movie synthesizer melody. Most everything else runs a diverse gamut of uninspiring retreads: uptempo krautpunk that sounds a bit like <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> standout &quot;Dead Bodies&quot; without the intensity (&quot;Be a Bee&quot;), lightheaded, minimalist tweaks of hotel-lounge disco (&quot;Love&quot;, which scans like George McCrae's &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; in a coma), mid-80s David Bowie with gastrointestinal discomfort (&quot;Missing the Light of the Day&quot;), a half-baked instrumental caricature of Blondie-sans-Debby (&quot;Eat My Beat&quot;), and a couple of pretty unconvincing attempts to incorporate Afrobeat (&quot;Night Hunter&quot;) and township music (&quot;African Velvet&quot;-- I wish I were making up that title).</p>\n<p>Thing is, it still sounds entirely like an Air album-- just a remarkably bland one. The complementary piano/synth lines that Dunckel and Godin made their stock in trade still dredge up a few legitimately nice melodies, though they typically prove fleeting. And session drummer-turned-auxiliary member Joey Waronker, well, he tries; he's one of the better motorik beat-deployment specialists going, and even he can't jostle much excitement into the proceedings, especially when his job most of the time is to tap out minimalist beats in one of the many tracks that pushes downtempo rhythms into complete stasis. <em>Love 2</em> exhibits the band's style by just about every familiar metric, except the one that made them fascinating in the first place-- that uncanny ability to make schlock sound beautiful. In its place is a strange reversal: beauty rendered schlock, pop melodies and space-age wonder curdled by damaged whimsy.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>We all know what horrors illegal downloading has wrought on new releases; one side effect of that erosion involves labels attempting to recoup those losses by re-animating their back catalogues, Mary Shelley style. Before the big swoon, it was tough to justify a reissue without a remaster, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and so lately, we've seen an increasing spate of albums re-released for no other reason than a round-number anniversary. In the cases of your <em>Thriller</em>s and your <em>Pet Sounds</em>, that's a justifiable enough benchmark-- in a way, those reissues provide the platform to talk about us and how much <em>we've</em> changed as much as the music. Something like the new deluxe edition of Air's <em>Moon Safari</em>, though, is a slightly trickier proposition.</p>\n<p>For starters: There's the niggling question of whether Air's debut, superb as it is, really merits canonical treatment. As a collection of songs, it's endured well enough over time; after a decade, it still holds up fine. But so have a ton of other similarly acclaimed and successful records from 1998, and it doesn't seem remotely appropriate to roll out the red carpet for those either. As far as modern connect points go, there's nothing really happening musically at the moment that makes <em>Moon Safari</em> suddenly worthy of re-examination. If anything, with its dainty sonics and polite arpeggios, a lot of this record runs counter to the discofied and Balearic dance that's currently in fashion. Even Air would quickly abandon the cultivated library music aesthetic that characterized this record in favor of spindlier, more complicated, more sinister material. So yeah: As a snapshot of a place in time, you could do a lot worse than <em>Moon Safari</em>. But as something to be canonized in a three-disc set? The physics are lost on me. What, aside from the poetry of the number 10, is the exact reason to celebrate it now?</p>\n<p>Granted, it probably wasn't Air's idea to do this, and it's certainly not their fault that <em>Moon Safari</em>'s legacy ultimately yielded a long list of bands along the lines of Lemon Jelly, Zero 7, Morcheeba, and Thievery Corporation, so perhaps it's fairer just to concentrate on what this reissue offers rather than the reason for it. The answer there, unfortunately, is: mixed returns. Although a robust collection featuring the original album, a disc of bonuses and B-sides, and a DVD featuring Mike Mills' 1999 tourfilm <em>Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing</em>, this reissue doesn't offer nearly enough in the way of substantive bonus material to warrant its existence, nor does it even select the right material from that era to re-package.</p>\n<p>The bonus disc is the biggest indicator of the lack of quality control or thoughtfulness on hand: instead of material from the duo's excellent surrounding EPs, <em>Le Soleil Est Pr\u00e8s De Moi</em> and the singles compilation <em>Premiers Sympt\u00f4mes</em> (a lot of which could actually benefit from having a light shone on it), we get five live tracks-- including a horrible, thrashy version of &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars&quot;-- which expose Air's live approach early on as light on musicianship and heavy on grating affectation and kitsch. Of the remaining demos and remixes, only the two-minute long, string-heavy take on &quot;Remember&quot; (itself a resurrected B-side) and a sparse demo of &quot;You Make It Easy&quot; (from when it was an instrumental called &quot;Bossa 96&quot;) are remotely illuminating. Everything else just feels incidental and reheated.</p>\n<p>Provided you like your filmmaking mannered and slightly cutesy, Mills' documentary remains a worthwhile curiosity, but even still, I can't imagine that anyone who'd be willing to shell out the money for a <em>Moon Safari</em> 10th Anniversary Edition wouldn't be acquainted with it already. Aside from that, you're basically paying for the packaging; in this case, that means a DVD-sized hardcover package with a nice, if slightly unnecessary, lyrics book attached. As a case for <em>Moon Safari</em> as a classic record, it falls a little short. But as a nice keepsake of a lovely record, it could be worse. I guess in the end it's really just a matter of whether you're fanatical enough about this album to buy it again. Virgin's either betting (or hoping) that enough of you are.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Air like to let you know what kind of album you're in for with the first couple of bars of their opening tracks. <em>Moon Safari</em> faded up with bongos on &quot;La Femme D'Argent&quot;, setting the stage for a loose and hep journey into space-age atmospherics. The &quot;do-do-thWACK&quot; S&amp;M whip of the drum machine opening to &quot;Electronic Performers&quot;, on the other hand, thrust us into the stiffer, shinier, more adventurous world of <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em>, wherein Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel sounded as if they'd been inhaling some of Dean and Gene Ween's Scotchgard. <em>Talkie Walkie</em> broke the percussion-only trend by pairing its opening beat with a strummed acoustic guitar and a stately piano refrain, introducing their warmest, brightest, and most song-oriented album. And on <em>Pocket Symphony</em>, the opening message is equally clear: The fluttering percussion on &quot;Space Maker&quot;, hovering all alone, sounds like it's bouncing off hard, cold surfaces. Which would seem to suggest that this will be Air's quietest and most austere offering.</p>\n<p>And so it is. There's a remarkable confidence on display here, that Air would choose to have their first album in three years be so spacious and moody, and so much less pop. They must know that they'll lose a few come-lately fans with music this relaxed and, well, sleepy. But the more you listen to <em>Pocket Symphony</em>, the more it becomes clear that it's remote by design. As they demonstrated throughout <em>Talkie Walkie</em> and on a few tracks per record on the previous two, Air can very capably write terrifically catchy songs when so inclined; here, they'd rather create finely-wrought furniture music. And they're good at it. Working again with Nigel Godrich, they've crafted what might be one of the year's best-<em>sounding</em> records, every lone piano note hanging improbably long in space and aloud to decay in what must be some unimaginably beautiful room.</p>\n<p>My first instinct was that <em>Pocket Symphony</em> was the return to <em>Moon Safari</em> territory fans wanted so desperately when <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em> first hit the shelves, but upon returning to their debut for the first time in a good while, that seems off. Yes, there's a quality to Godin's heavenly basslines that occasionally puts this record in a similar groovy headspace, but Air are light years from the earlier work's cheeky retro-futurisms. In the formal world of <em>Pocket Symphony</em>, a squelchy Moog would be considered vulgar, the unpredictability of its aged circuits no substitute for the absolute control of a grand piano, a finely brushed acoustic guitar, or the Japanese koto. Air are ready to unplug here at a moment's notice, and the space in which these acoustic instruments was recorded counts as an instrument in itself.</p>\n<p>Four of these dozen tracks are purely instrumental, but the ratio feels higher-- many of the poppier songs seem to be about arrangement and shading first. Jarvis Cocker chips in on &quot;One Hell of a Party&quot;, his husky, downcast voice suiting the song's metaphor (relationship as hedonistic soiree to be reckoned with the morning after), and yet the frame of the song is so skeletal that the sentiment never gathers weight. This might seem to mirror the bombed-out nature of the lyric, but that's an intellectualization; it's ultimately just an OK, verging-on-dull song. Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy sings lead on &quot;Somewhere Between Walking and Sleeping&quot; and the result-- muted, vaguely bland-- is again just serviceable.</p>\n<p>The pop songs that Dunckel sings are better suited to the album's frame of mind, serving more as sketches, the sort of half-written catchphrases that exist, in the &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars&quot; sense, mostly to build a chord structure around. The creamy layers of voice during the &quot;without you&quot; chorus in &quot;Left Bank&quot;, along with the upbeat &quot;Mer du Japon&quot;-- one of the best songs they've written and the album's best track-- are as close as Air get to <em>Talkie Walkie\u00ad</em>-level hooks. Elsewhere, it's more subtle hints and raised eyebrows than fleshed-out songs, whether the prickly synth and robotic swing of &quot;Napalm Love&quot; with its three-note melody or the crisp, lightly echoed spaciousness of &quot;Photograph&quot;, which clicks along like patent leather boots down a dark marble hallway.</p>\n<p>On every pass through the record, it seems clearer that the sound of <em>Pocket Symphony</em> is the album's real content. And that sound, no question, is exquisite. But it's also hard to hold in your head after the record stops playing, so <em>Pocket Symphony</em> winds up feeling strangely transient, accomplished and genuinely likeable but also forgettable.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Now that we've allegedly traded the Age of the Album for the Age of the Playlist, there are quite a few compilation series like this one, wherein your favorite acts root through their record collections and offer a home-listening mixtape. The concept tends to be most enlightening when it comes to acts that make electronic music, and not just because they're presumed to be better music scholars. The truth is that we tend to talk about electronic acts in relation to <em>other</em> electronic acts-- the ones on the same labels, the ones that use the same tools and techniques, the same synths and software. With the right mix, musicians like these can try to place themselves within a much larger tradition of <em>songwriting</em>, and spell out what it is they'd be interested in whether they were writing for digital keyboards or chamber quartets.</p>\n<p>This installment of the <em>LateNightTales</em> series pairs up with Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel's solo project as the total fall publicity for Air. It's also one of the best of this type of mix I've heard in a while. For one thing, Air have taken the &quot;Late Night&quot; part of the title <em>very</em> seriously, making for an incredibly functional, utilitarian mix. Only a very few tracks here have anything approaching a conventional drum kit, and a good portion of the set consists of moody film-score work and orchestral pieces: These songs are matched up on their slow movement and their spare, deliberate sound. The result is uniformly pensive and weighty, painted in deep, dark colors-- a mix for the deadest hours of night.</p>\n<p>And since Air have always been pop songwriters more than any kind of &quot;electronic&quot; act, they manage to offer a terrific picture of the music that informs their own recordings. The most colorful track here is Minnie Ripperton's still-gorgeous &quot;Lovin' You&quot;, a track whose twinkling 70s keys are an obvious antecedent to Air's <em>Moon Safari</em>. (They also sound so pure and natural that it's hard to remember why that album had to give them the occasional ironic wink.) There are also plenty of examples of the kind of very-grave, very-French baritone drama that clearly informs the group's later albums. The way Japan's &quot;Ghosts&quot; suspends David Sylvian's voice over an abyss, with only the odd keyboard accent to keep it company; the way Scott Walker and Lee Hazlewood rumble their way through deep reverb over plush arrangements-- what else would you expect Air to be listening to?</p>\n<p>The band's choices here turn out to be consistently interesting, too, and should prove worthwhile even to someone who already digs through this kind of stuff on her own. Sofia Coppola might have beat them to anthologizing the Cure's &quot;All Cats Are Grey&quot;, and a Cat Power chestnut in the middle kind of breaks the spell, but the majority of the picks are damned clever. Jeff Alexander's &quot;Come Wander With Me&quot; seems like it should be some vintage English or Greenwich-Village folk, until you look it up and find out it was composed for an episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. There's some of the sedate, flanged-out psychedelic music people forget Black Sabbath tended to make. The folky second half skips from a Robert Wyatt lullaby to Elliott Smith to the Troggs' whispery &quot;Cousin Jane&quot;-- something like the Stones' &quot;I Am Waiting&quot; if it never got around to the rock part. There's a string piece from the Chinese composer Tan Dun, a bit of Nino Rota, a suddenly sunny break from S\u00e9bastien Tellier, and-- for the closer-- the Cleveland Orchestra playing Ravel.</p>\n<p>Which means this disc is surprising, satisfying, and most of all very, very functional. The trouble with most home-listening mixes, here in the Age of the Playlist, is that you could quite easily throw together a bunch of songs you liked on your own. Air are smart enough to specialize-- to do a mix for an exact mood, an exact time of night, the kind of deep and deliberate music that sounds right when everything else seems too loud, too much. You could try to piece something similar together from your mp3 collection, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be half as good-- and besides, you'd have already heard it all.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>When attempting to encapsulate the essence of Paris in a word, Evelyn Waugh endearingly deemed the city &quot;bogus.&quot; In his travelogue, <em>Labels</em>, he wrote, &quot;It seems to me this scrap of jargon, in every gradation of meaning... gives a very adequate expression of the essence of modern Paris.&quot; Thanks mostly to San Dimas High School, in the seventy sum years since Waugh's trip, the term-- and bogus journeys, in general-- has evolved into a firm negative. Waugh, however, <em>enjoyed</em> Parisians' ability to dismiss nostalgia in art and revel in the present without regard to the future, past, or public reception. In so few words, the French don't give a fuck.</p>\n<p>Because of this, American audiences continually underestimate French music, assuming our rigid filters of &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;ironic&quot; apply. Admittedly, the cultural barrier is difficult to overcome: Daft Punk's masked robot disco, Gainsbourg's reggae, and Phoenix's flying-V Steely Dan tribute seem cute and studied when compared to the supposed bleeding-on-wax of our idolized Kurts and Jimis. As such, investing emotionally in &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; was akin to a Cubs fan buying playoff tickets. Air's revered debut hit cosmetic commercials within weeks of its release and goes great with a dry Chardonnay. <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em> opened with synthetic voices proclaiming, &quot;We are electronic performers,&quot; before 10cc choruses toyingly queried, &quot;How does it make you feel?&quot;</p>\n<p>Which makes the overwhelming beauty and longing of <em>Talkie Walkie</em> that much more stunning. No longer are Air's sincerities lost in translation. The album title (no, they're not being cute, that's just how they say it in French) knowingly acknowledges this fact. Like the communication devices, <em>Talkie Walkie</em> sounds intimate, yet distant and distorted. Hope Sandoval nailed &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; on a demo, yet in forgoing guest vocalists for the first time, Air unerringly personalize their songwriting. Stomping piano and opiated gospel handclaps march &quot;Venus&quot; in a brutal funereal pace through keyboards that break like dead, pale winter sunlight and falling ice. Tolling bells and crickets take the song into twilight. Somehow it's numbingly romantic. Atonal music boxes, Plutonian pings, and digital fugues create a Side One that evokes purgatorial drifting, running out of oxygen, and passing into the light after a Space Walk disaster.</p>\n<p>The second half with the propulsive &quot;Surfin' on a Rocket&quot;, whistling &quot;Alpha Beta Gaga&quot;, banjo-laced &quot;Biological&quot;, and the Japanese imperial garden suite, &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot;, reconstitute Brian Wilson's surfing symphonies through Bowie and Eno's Berlin flipsides. Nigel Godrich, rather than supplying his default clean, shimmering production that can homogenize artists such as Beck, Travis, and The Divine Comedy, betters some of his Radiohead A-game here. The album's chilling resonance is due in part to Godrich's anagogical recording of minimal instrumentation and digitally etiolated detail.</p>\n<p>Being the good Parisians of Waugh's estimation, Air load <em>Talkie Walkie</em> with images of moonbase love and alien encounters that neither mocks the comically misjudged visions of yellowed science fiction, nor longs for some utopian future. Air creates the alternate now, an environment that begs escapism without denying humanity. <em>Talkie Walkie</em> may mollify Air's overt Frenchness, but should in no way be deemed a sudden opening of the soul. In their insular way, Air have always been soul. They've simply grown more cosmopolitan, and not just in their solubility with vodka, Cointreau and cranberry.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Ora capisco cosa si prova ad ascoltare i Looper quando non si conosce l'inglese. Do you understand this sentence? It says, &quot;Now I know what it feels like to listen to Looper when you can't understand English,&quot; as translated into Italian by Google. And what I mean by it is this: If you don't know Italian, I wouldn't recommend picking up this record.</p>\n<p><em>City Reading</em> is a collaboration between Air and writer Alessandro Baricco, in which Baricco reads text from his novel, <em>City</em>, to Air's backing tracks. The three explain how it went down in the liner notes:</p>\n<p>*&quot;*City <em>is a book. The idea was to read some pages of it aloud, in a theater full of people, with musical accompaniment throughout. We did this in Rome, in November of 2002. It went well. The audience applauded, and we enjoyed ourselves. So the idea became: to make a CD in which a voice is reading, surrounded by music. We recorded the CD in Paris, a month later. We enjoyed ourselves. Now the idea is to make a video game. But we're not really sure about that.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I don't doubt that this pairing set the Roman throng cheering. Air's tasteful, wistful, and occasionally mournful tunes are an intelligent compliment to a reading, and their decision to mix lots of acoustic guitar with organ, flute and sound effects subliminally bonds with the plot (<em>City</em> is a trilogy of surreal, poetic Westerns.) And however Baricco's prose reads in his native language (an English translation is included in the CD booklet), there's no doubting that he has a fantastically great speaking voice-- clear, rhythmic, musical and dramatic. It was, I'm sure, an inspired pairing.</p>\n<p>All that, however, isn't enough to add up to repeated listens for me, because I can't follow it. I tried scanning the English translation of the text while listening, but it didn't interest me. Baricco's voice is <em>very</em> high in the mix, so much so that focusing on anything but him speaking the words is impossible. Even so, it probably wouldn't matter much if the mix were more music-oriented. Somewhere back there, behind Baricco's purr, Air's tracks sound nice enough, although the cues they've constructed are obviously repetitive and meant as a soundtrack to something more important.</p>\n<p>Though I get off on the pure sound of language as much as the next guy, I still don't find <em>City Reading</em> entertaining. I'm not complaining, really. It is what it is, and there's certainly no reason why Air should feel compelled to pander to my embarrassing monolingualism by working with, say, an English writer. All I can say is that <em>City Reading</em> is essentially a book on tape with high production values in a language I don't understand, and that, even if it were released in an instrumental version, it wouldn't be particularly breathtaking. Caveat emptor.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

The results have been fast, effective, and largely painless. She's taken to the Pixies, and I've taken to, um, lots of sex.</p>\n<p>Air's debut, 1998's <em>Moon Safari</em>, is not only a pop classic of retro-futurism; it also provides a damn fine soundtrack to the otherworldly act of sex. Needless to say, we became well acquainted with the album, which both of us were already fond of to begin with. Their soundtrack to Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, 2000's <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>, was a similarly fluid pour of analog synths, but the album was a less pop-oriented, more minor-key affair. And if you've seen the movie, you can understand why I wouldn't want to do &quot;the beast with two backs&quot; while listening to its irrevocably-linked score.</p>\n<p>So would Air's official follow-up to <em>Moon Safari</em> be a return to coital form? I'll let my girlfriend do the talking:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Weird.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>That would be the opener, &quot;Electronic Performers.&quot; She wasn't necessarily turned off by the deep bass thumps that rip into electronic handclaps. Or the occasional heavy rapping, like the landlord at your door a day after the rent's due. And it definitely wasn't the radar beeps or the fluctuating machinations of the keyboard. I think it was the vocals. Accompanied by a natural piano, a distorted voice sings, &quot;We are the synchronizers/ Send messages through time code.&quot; And it <em>is</em> weird, like something Dean and Gene Ween would come up with. But with lines such as, &quot;We need to use envelope filters/ To say how we feel,&quot; the track is also an oddly beautiful lament.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;The Radiohead voice!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Yes, a whispery version of the fitter, happier Macintalk voice makes an appearance on the love song, &quot;How Does It Make You Feel?&quot; But a real voice-- resident keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr.-- sings the ELO-inspired chorus. The beat, meanwhile, is cut from the exact same mold as <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>-- from the dark, ambling pace all the way down to the angelic voices coalescing in the background. But whereas that album-- and &quot;the Radiohead voice,&quot; for that matter-- remain serious to the end, this song concludes with a funny moment. After listing off his feelings, the male computerized voice receives an abrupt retort from a female computerized voice: &quot;Well, I really think you should quit smoking.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;It's like rock-n-roll.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;The Vagabond&quot; makes you wish for a full-length Beck/Air collaboration. But at first, it's all Beck: a harmonica solo, folky acoustic strumming, Beck's distinctive, marble-mouthed vocals, and tolls ringing in the background. You'd think he donated a b-side from <em>Mutations</em>. That's when Air's laser-gun atmospherics shoot forth. The drums that kick in midway are also decidedly more similar to Air's previous work. Beck even ends the number with his trademark falsetto and a cackling laugh a la &quot;Hollywood Freaks,&quot; so yes, she's right: this is rock-n-roll. But then again, a moment later she said, &quot;Honey, isn't rock-n-roll a weird name?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Is this the same album?&quot;</em></p>\n<p>By the halfway mark, &quot;Lucky and Unhappy,&quot; the poor girl had been thrown for more than one loop-- not to mention &quot;Radian,&quot; Air's most overwrought Bacharach-inspired track to date. And now here was this untraceable throbbing, this eerie computerized whirring, voices of different distortions, and an acoustic guitar to ground it all; then a skittering beat and a swirling orchestra; and even later, static popping and off-key keyboards.</p>\n<p>Songs from the album's second half provided little relief. &quot;Sex Born Poison&quot; pairs a vocoderized voice with the Japanese vocals of Buffalo Daughter; then, for good measure, adds what sounds like digital Ping-Pong-- or maybe the noises &quot;Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!&quot; makes while Little Mac is popping King Hippo in the gut and mouth. After opening with a thick electro-pulse and digi-congos, the chantey &quot;People in the City&quot; reaches a simple acoustic epiphany-- think the Beta Band's &quot;Dry the Rain&quot;-- before descending into muddled feedback and heavy electronic gurgling. And the final number, &quot;Caramel Prisoner,&quot; is an ambient come-down-- kind of like a rollercoaster coming to rest with a bloody, broken-nosed Fabio aboard.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;I like it, but it's kind of all over the place.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I'm a little scared to admit it, but we're on the same page here. The barely cohesive <em>10,000 Hz Legend</em> is both a concern and a relief. There's only one truly catchy song-- the <em>Low</em>-era Bowie-esque &quot;Radio #1&quot;-- but it doesn't have quite the same bounce (not to mention single potential) as &quot;Sexy Boy.&quot; So you probably won't hear any of these songs on the radio, and I can say with absolute certainty that this won't be <em>Details</em>' album of the year, as <em>Moon Safari</em> was. I don't say this because it matters, but rather to indicate that Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\\xEEt Dunckel have steadfastly refused to be pigeonholed. For better or worse, this is not <em>Moon Safari Redux</em>.</p>\n<p>The obvious comparison that my girlfriend should have made is to the Chemical Brothers, who took a similar stylistic leap on their last album, 1999's <em>Surrender</em>, even though staying the big-beat course would have been the easier and more profitable thing to do. But for some reason Spike Lee's work also comes to mind: there are plenty of hits and misses, but the experience is worth it for the invigorating knowledge that this critically established artist isn't afraid to take his art in new directions. Plus, my girlfriend and I love that Spike always slips a hot sex scene into his films.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Since their humble beginnings on <em>Premiers Symptomes</em>, their 1997 debut EP, Air haven't striven for much more than to bring a French flavor to spacy electronic pop. Even back then, this was by no means an original concept. Hundreds of bands-- Stereolab, Dimitri from Paris, Komeda, etc.-- preceded Air with Bacharachian melodies and Moog hisses scattered throughout their albums like trademark logos. But while their predecessors carried themselves on kitsch value and band-of-the-moment media praise, Air seemed somehow more serious about their music.</p>\n<p>Is the world really interested in another Air release, though? <em>Premiers Symptomes</em> and <em>Moon Safari</em>, while intriguing albums for their genre, were somewhat similar in mood and direction. Both showed a band whose intent was to create instrumental French space-pop, and not much else. And with the &quot;French space-pop revolution&quot; pretty much over and done with, what could a new Air record possibly offer that the duo hasn't already accomplished?</p>\n<p>Well, from the sound of <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>, the score to Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\\xEEt Dunckel have a bit more to achieve before their 15 seconds tick to a close. Though the record does aim for the same kind of prog-rock atmospherics as their earlier releases, Air have managed to alter their sound this time out, drawing from a wider array of rock influences, instead of limiting their scope to Perrey and Kingsley.</p>\n<p>Godin and Dunckel have a larger arsenal of instruments here. The bulk of the equipment implemented still seems to be a diverse assortment of analog keyboards, but Air also incorporate those dependable traditional rock instruments, guitar and bass. It's a marked improvement from the synth surplus of their previous material. The band also seems more influenced by the melodic psychedelic rock of the late 60's and early 70's than before. There are distinct nods to Pink Floyd's <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> and especially the Beatles' <em>Abbey Road</em>. The Beatles' influence is most notable on &quot;Bathroom Girl,&quot; &quot;Cemetary Party,&quot; and &quot;Highschool Lover (Theme from 'The Virgin Suicides'),&quot; during which several of the drum fills and guitar squalls sound almost directly snatched from <em>Abbey Road</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> has its dry moments, but surprisingly, they're few and far between. For the most part, the album showcases Godin and Dunckel's dramatically improved songwriting skills. The majority of these 13 tracks actually feature a true rarity for rock music these days-- unpredictable chord progressions. And the album undeniably serves its purpose: it's a film score. The fact that it holds your attention, despite being created solely as incidental music, says something about the guys playing it. Whether we want to admit it or not, Air are pretty good at what they do. Still, the backlash is well underway at this point, and it seems doubtful they'll hold up quite as well by the time their &quot;official&quot; follow-up to <em>Moon Safari</em> sees release later this year.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Gothenburg, located on the west coast of Sweden, averages highs in the upper 60s in June; in recent years, however, the city has produced some of the sunniest music in the world. Tropical rhythms and warm-weather themes color releases by Jens Lekman, the Tough Alliance, Studio, and the Embassy-- all of whom have recorded for Gothenburg-based label Service. TTA and Studio have since founded their own labels, each with its own cryptic website. Signed to TTA's Sincerely Yours, Air France invited listeners to their &quot;Beach Party&quot; with last year's too-good-to-be-true <em>On Trade Winds</em> EP. Air France's latest, the 23-minute <em>No Way Down</em> EP, is better.</p>\n<p>The seaside disco of the Gothenburg groups shares many traits with the DJ-ing style named after the Balearic archipelago, off the coast of Spain. Dreamed up on the Balearic island of Ibiza by Argentina-born DJ Alfredo Fiorito in the mid-1980s and soon brought to London, the sound spanned laid-back, groove-oriented music ranging from conga-accented Italo disco and the iridescent proto-techno of Manuel G\u00f6ttsching's classic <em>E2-E4</em> to hypnotic indie rock by the Woodentops and offbeat selections from soft-rock, prog, and global pop music. As a DJ-centered art, Balearic house was inherently based on manipulations of other people's music.</p>\n<p>Balearic is far from the only musical perspective that can unite an eclectic variety of records without regard to genre or historical context. As the KLF observed in their book <em>The Manual: How to Have a Number One the Easy Way</em>, &quot;All records in the Top 10 (especially those that get to #1) have far more in common with each other than with whatever genre they have developed from or sprung out of.&quot; That's true from &quot;Take Five&quot; to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. What distinguishes the music of Air France and their Sincerely Yours colleagues from the more rock- and groove-oriented sounds of Studio or Norwegian cosmic disco DJs like Lindstr\u00f8m, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje is that they've taken to heart not only Balearic, but also the teachings of chart pop.</p>\n<p>Air France use elements of both Balearic and pop to create their sumptuous, sincere fantasy world. In that respect, Air France's <em>No Way Down--</em> currently import-only outside of Sweden <a href=\"http://www.klicktrack.com/sy/releases/air-france/no-way-down\"><strong>except as 320 kbps mp3s</strong></a>-- is reminiscent of the Avalanches' dazzlingly great <em>Since I Left You</em>, another record that finds wide-eyed delight in silly stuff like truth, beauty, and fun, as well as Jens Lekman's <em>Night Falls Over Kortedala</em> and the Tough Alliance's <em>A New Chance</em>. It imagines an impossibly idyllic place through sounds that probably could never have been performed that way in real life. Though it's been said, many times, many ways: Welcome to paradise.</p>\n<p>Unlike Balearic disco contemporaries such as Studio or A Mountain of One, <em>No Way Down</em> does childlike joy, not hypnotized headiness. Typewriter-like clicks and John Williams-ready horn fanfares, complete with tympani, introduce the opener, &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;. This track soon settles into chilled-out synth washes and sober piano melodies, establishing a tone of sincerity without sacrificing lush outdoor beauty. The swooning string flourishes on finale &quot;Windmill Wedding&quot; aren't far off from the introduction to hip-hop producer Bangladesh's ubiqitous beat for Lil Wayne's &quot;A Milli&quot;. Electric guitar and piano ripple across each other like waves, giving way to Spanish-tinged guitar, percussive human breaths, broken-up female vocals, church bells, and bird chirps. The <em>coup de gr\u00e2ce</em>: the whinnying of a horse. You can almost picture someone's gallant lover galloping across the surf.</p>\n<p>Other tracks are more in the foamy wake of the group's breakout indie late-2006 track &quot;Beach Party&quot;. &quot;Collapsing at Your Doorstep&quot; is gorgeously produced, stupidly catchy, and totally affecting, with an elegant dance groove and an infectious hook. The verses throw lyrics to the wind in favor of wildlife sounds, congas, and woodwinds, which bask in harp glissandos and G\u00f6ttsching-esque guitar filigrees, plus some string and horn samples. &quot;No more, no more, no more, no morals anymore/ Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door,&quot; a woman seems to be singing, followed by children's voices: &quot;Sorta like a dream?&quot; &quot;No -- better.&quot; Nearly as perfect is &quot;No Excuses&quot;, with handclaps and a yearning chorus: &quot;No excuses left/ Waiting to fail, but not quite yet.&quot; It's like Saint Etienne for an endless summer.</p>\n<p>As with many other gifted pop and Balearic artists, Air France also happen to be sticky-fingered. Their sources are varied, yet the pleasure isn't recognizing the different sonic elements, but in relishing their almost supernatural co-existence. &quot;Beach Party&quot; lifted its hook from Lisa Stansfield. The <em>No Way Down</em> title track directly quotes the Happy Mondays. The melancholy intro that precedes Go! Team-esque horns and cheers on &quot;June Evenings&quot; is from late-1980s TV fantasy-romance &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, as are the children's voices on &quot;Collapsing at Your Doorstep&quot;, describing both the show's fantastical underground world and the joy of being with someone you love. If <em>No Way Down</em> is about a place that doesn't exist, it's a place where fairy tales are true and where old pop culture ephemera can-- in Air France's fertile musical imagination, at least-- live happily ever after.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>There's a scene in <em>The Graduate</em> where Benjamin Braddock is relaxing in the pool, directly after the montage that follows his first sexual encounter with Mrs. Robinson. His father asks him what he's doing, and Benjamin says, &quot;Well, I would say that I'm just drifting here in the pool.&quot; His father wants to know why, and Ben answers, &quot;Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here.&quot; Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid and Bobby Donne of Labradford are two men who understand such comforts. And together, as Aix Em Klemm, they've created a very pleasant place to drift.</p>\n<p>It's fun to hear a collaborative record like this, where every note can easily be traced to its creator. I imagine Wiltzie to be responsible for the gorgeous guitar drones that pulsate through &quot;Prue Lewarne&quot; and &quot;The Girl with the Flesh Colored Crayon.&quot; Both tracks feature the delicate, low-level hum that his full-time band perfected on <em>The Ballasted Orchestra</em>. Wiltzie also vocalizes on both these tracks (calling it singing isn't quite right) in hushed, reverberating tones. His vocals are just another shading, really, the melody flowing with the current instead of paddling anywhere on its own. The voice is effective, adding a welcome layer of gloomy ambience.</p>\n<p>Labradford's brand of quiet music has always been too ordered and precise for my taste, somehow lacking a vital emotional component. But on <em>Aix Em Klemm</em>, Bobby Donne's contributions seem the perfect counterpoint to Wiltzie's organic guitar sculpture. On &quot;3x2 (exit),&quot; I'm guessing that Donne contributes the high-pitched buzz that burrows between the sheets of feedback, as I remember something similar from <em>E Luxo So</em>. And the otherwise respectful &quot;Sophteonal,&quot; which consists mostly of slowly repeated electric guitar picking and delicate piano, gains much from a disorienting layer of computer manipulation. I'm reminded of Markus Popp's contributions to Gastr del Sol's <em>Camoufleur</em>, the way he ran the acoustic information through his notebook computer and returned a digital ghost to the mix. These high-tech embellishments add textures that the lo-fi Stars of the Lid would be unlikely to attempt, and are a large part of what makes this collaboration unusual.</p>\n<p>The final track, &quot;Twentyone,&quot; is a theft of Angelo Badalamenti's &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; theme, with its dreamy piano chords and too-pure bassline, but it's so pretty we can forgive the transgression. This is a lovely piece of ambient drone rock, and fans of either band will not be disappointed.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's a sound that seems so familiar to me as I walk through Alphabet City: discarded Duane Reade bags and fountain drink caps with straws still jabbed in them all rattling together in New York's rancid winds, fragments of trash and continuous street din, all mashed together as odors and noises both noxious and intoxicating. It's the sound of years' worth of journal-like tapes made by Japanese improviser and current New York denizen Aki Onda.</p>\n<p>Although his long history involves working with Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye, Nick Cave collaborator Blixa Bargeld, Mego Records' pop deconstructionist Tujiko Noriko, and glitch pioneer Nobukazu Takemura, as well as releasing music under the name of Audio Sports, this is a highly personal work dealing with Onda's own memories, or rather, a trace of memories captured by a handheld tape recorder. Through re-examining these lost moments of time spent wandering the labyrinthine cityscape, Onda has processed and tweaked aspects of the captured fragments and played them back in real time. Certain sounds rise out of the consomm\u00e9, but they all get fed back into the mix, conjuring landscapes lost yet re-contextualized in the swirl of noise and wind.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, I'd compare a piece like the opening &quot;One Day&quot; to the sort of psychedelia practiced by Austrian guitarist Christian Fennesz (circa <em>Instrument</em>), in that he takes the mundane sounds of a guitar and crafts something far greater as it loops and extends itself beyond its original shape. Onda spins a similar vortex from a forgotten lobe in the tapehead, taking in mechanistic clicks and sax honks from the street, along with an undertow of playground chatter, and twisting it together with a warped clatter of tinny percussion. &quot;Eclipse&quot; jumps around a bit more-- all ice cream trucks, cafe orders, and noisy jams cutting in and out-- before settling into a drony, indeterminate haze of sounds that flicker past like subway car windows under the street. The visual quality of French composer Luc Ferrari is a touchstone for these sounds, too. The opening burst of Tompkins Square Park percussion and bum hollers on &quot;Dream&quot; echoes the bongo fury that opens his <em>Danses Organiques</em>.</p>\n<p>Cinema plays a great role in organizing the clamor. Onda openly acknowledges his debt to visionaries of the medium such as Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas. To that list I would add Chris Marker (an influence on Fennesz as well), as throughout this disc of &quot;cassette memories,&quot; he blends and blurs the audio fact with the subtle manipulations of the fictional and fanciful until it's impossible to separate the two extremes. &quot;Last&quot; has all the buzzy breath of prime Dead C stench, with tapes chirping backwards and gas pipes pinging about. The racket pushes and pulls with delirious speed, frames held for a second before blurring again. Even built from such cast-off garbage sounds, grimy and lo-fi, the residue of these hand-held tapes has a hypnotic and fascinating effect. It's bits of fiery loft-jazz breath, yellow taxi traffic, rat death, Puerto Rican children in the streets, drunks yelling, pigeon shit, and the subway scrapes of raw brakes screaming in unified chorus. Welcome to New York.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>As the title suggests, Akira Kosemura's entrancing <em>Polaroid Piano</em> is a wistful meditation for minimal piano and field recordings, bleached out with old light. The glitchy electronics of Kosemura's prior work are gone. The music is so hushed you can hear the action of the pedals, the keyboard shifting in the body of the piano. This quiet rumpus serves as a relaxed rhythm track-- one suspects Kosemura mic'd the piano to capture these extraneous sounds, drawing them purposefully into the music. The gesture is Cagean, but the questioning, wonder-filled style is pure Satie. The cover art captures the mood perfectly, although a blue sky filled with kites and balloons would have been just as apt.</p>\n<p>Music described approvingly as &quot;childlike&quot; strives for a rich, timeless simplicity that makes us forget about the constructed world we worry over. <em>Polaroid Piano</em> is stuffed with this feeling, not to mention some more blatant signifiers. A toy xylophone plinks through the sustained piano and softly rubbed acoustic guitar strings of &quot;Higari&quot;.  On &quot;Sign&quot;, birdsong twitters above the tentative piano phrases, while the faint sound of acoustic guitar ripples forward and backward. On &quot;Tale&quot;, Kosemura cuts to the chase with a field recording of children playing over xylophone and sleigh bells. Bound to be the most divisive moment on the record, &quot;Tale&quot; will make your eyes either roll or tear up.</p>\n<p>A few pieces break <em>Polaroid Piano</em>'s mold in careful ways. On &quot;Tyme&quot;, the busiest piece here, the greater speed and density of the notes makes the clunks and creaks of the piano sound like an old copy machine. On &quot;Guitar&quot;, guitar and piano notes blur amid crackling, fiery sounds and lightly scratched strings. And closer &quot;Venice&quot;, the album's longest piece, is contrastingly liquid, with piano swirling against the lulling sound of water flowing calmly. Because it's so transient and mild-- 10 pieces flow by in less than half an hour-- the album, paradoxically, expands with multiple listens. It feels impossible to get tired of, circumscribed and boundless at once, and it's so subtle that you might let it spin two or three times before you start to notice the repetition.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The latest installment in London club Fabric's mix series, <em>Fabric 17</em>, is one of its best, which might come as a surprise considering that unlike the label's other recent successes it was compiled and mixed not by an internationally reknowned DJ such as Jacques Lu Cont or Michael Mayer but by Akufen (Marc Leclair). Which isn't to say that the Quebecois doesn't have the acumen or skill to present a seamless and engaging mix-- the record proves that he most certainly does-- Leclair just hadn't yet displayed that element of his talents. An accomplished producer, he is still best known for his debut LP <em>My Way</em> and his process of microsampling, taking small snippets of FM radio, white noise, and other sounds and pulling them together into a coherent whole.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the spirit of Akufen's hallmark style permeates <em>Fabric 17</em>. As he does with the sonic detritus with which he normally works, Leclair employs only what he needs from the tracks he's selected, shaving off all but only 90 only seconds of some, allowing others to run nearly their full lengths, and doing some good ol' fashioned mixing when it suits him-- most notably on an opening section that blends Philippe Cam's &quot;LFO Drive&quot; and the Pantytec remix of Matthew Dear's &quot;Dog Days&quot;. This inspired pairing kicks off a nearly perfect seven-track section of some of the choicest tracks in recent leftfield techno, highlighted by Pantytec's own &quot;Alabaster&quot; and The Rip Off Artist's &quot;Little Tiny Eight Inch Jack&quot;.</p>\n<p>Akufen favors tracks that mirror the best of his own productions-- abstract techno and tech-house that uses its more glitchy elements as elastic funk rather than simply as synapse-triggering pops and buzzes. The mix skips and bounds, twists and whirls rather than works itself into a propulsive groove; it also displays Leclair's sense of humor. Leclair crosses the line from sly wit into lampshade wearing when he slips on Senor Coconut's cover of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. That track doesn't entirely blend well; but what's more, because this Latin-tinged psuedocomedy classic rock cover follows on the heels of a few other more deft FM radio references (e.g. &quot;my Maserati does 185&quot;), it feels almost as if Lecalir told a great joke but then soured the moment by still feeling the need to explain the punchline.</p>\n<p>On the album's second half, Leclair reps his country with tracks from Jeff Milligan, Crackhaus, and one of that production group's member, Stephen Beuapre. When he reaches into his bag for one of his own records, it's the Mike Shannon Incision mix of &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;, a track Leclair recorded as Horror Inc. A little less track-y and little more noirish, the mix's second half features some big guns (Herbert, Soul Center, Wighnomy Brothers, Luciano, Freaks), but it never matches the admittedly high bar set by those first seven tracks.</p>\n<p>That isn't to say the record simply runs out of steam-- it remains playful and head-turning throughout, and it displays both Akufen's solid ear and his knack for discarding ideas before they drag past their point. Leclair's mix may not ebb and flow, but it doesn't aim to either. Instead, on his first mix Leclair seems restless and giddy, like a child excitedly moving between new toys without tiring of any of them. I guess that sometimes impatience is a virtue.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Some things never get old. I could eat a cream cheese bagel every morning for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. Unfortunately, the musical equivalent of a cream cheese bagel is hard to find. Most artists, albums or genres, if I hear too much over a certain period, eventually start to wear. Often this happens gradually over a long stretch of time, so gradually that I can't pinpoint when my affection started to change. Other times my dissatisfaction comes over me in a wave and I have a moment of clarity.</p>\n<p>I believe Akufen's <em>My Way</em> marks the precise moment I started to get a little bored of this strand of microhouse. It's not really fair to Akufen that it happened to catch me at this time, because as records in this genre go, this is a good one. The beats are crisp and funky, a good many of the melodies are memorable, and the concept is interesting enough. A quick note on the latter-- Akufen (Mark Leclair of Montreal) uses a technique he calls &quot;microsampling&quot; to gather raw materials for his tracks. This method involves recording tiny fragments of radio transmissions and recontextualizing the sounds into his pumping, stripped down house rhythms. Favorite Akufen snippets are brief acoustic guitar riffs, one-syllable vocalizations, and quick string stabs. It's a distinctive sonic signature that gives his tracks load of possibility.</p>\n<p>And it sounds good, really it does. Yet, the half dozen times I listened to this album, my primary thought was, <em>Do I need another record that sounds like this?</em> Even though Akufen meticulously builds complex riffs into these tracks from dozens of stray sound fragments, and even though he layers these sounds above propulsive and endlessly danceable beats, <em>My Way</em> doesn't really stand out for me. In truth, when the thick clusters of sampled sound get past a certain density, I just find them annoying.</p>\n<p>My favorite track on <em>My Way</em> is the most focused, the overtly pretty &quot;Skidoos.&quot; It takes its time building up from an opening of dubby percussion and processed samples, but after a vaporous synth drone folds in, the 4/4 beat and grabby bassline identify the tune as an energizing dance track. Key to its appeal is the ping-ponging vocal riff that appears and reappears, a killer hook that makes the track seem close to a 'song' in the traditional sense of the word, even though the singing is clipped and wordless. Beats this danceable deserve a little bit of pop, and &quot;Skidoos&quot; does not disappoint. If I ever make it inside a club again, I hope to hear something as blissed out as this.</p>\n<p>After that peak, the rest of <em>My Way</em> is fine and reliable but never great. &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; has some R&amp;B; vocal samples with similar emotional power, although the cluttered arrangement diminishes the return. &quot;Deck the House&quot; takes the prize in terms of technical expertise, with chords, rhythms, melodies and counter-melodies all generated from tiny dust particles of sound that fly past so quickly your brain barely has time to make out the pattern. After that, there's a whole lot of 'this sounds interesting' and very little engagement. The truth is, I'm not sure how much new glitchy house I need in my collection at the moment. I still find Farben and Herbert stunning, and MRI's <em>All That Glitters</em> remains great fun. But I do know that when I next reach for something in this vein, Akufen will fall pretty far down my list.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but pick up and move to Finland. In the summer, it's almost unbearably hot where I live, my rent's too high, and no offense family, but you're just not cutting it. Furthermore, the Fins have the best music: in the last year I've been fortunate enough to jam to new records by Circle, Luomo, Varttina, Gjallarhorn, Pharaoh Overlord, Uzva and now Alamaailman Vasarat. They say it's cold there. They say people drink profusely and go for weeks without talking. Never mind all that, I'll just stake out a Helsinki street corner somewhere, slip a Sibelius disc in the Walkman, and witness the magic. I'm going to do that right now.</p>\n<p>However, my love of all that Finnish music is only eclipsed by my tendency for procrastination: bringing you the details on AV's <em>K\u00e4\u00e4rmelautakunta</em> will have to do. This band (translated as &quot;The Hammers of the Underworld&quot;) is an offshoot of the defunct avant-prog ensemble H\u00f6yry-Kone, who were as likely to break into Iron Maiden as they were to launch epic King Crimson-style rave-ups. Drummer Teemu Hanninen and bassist-come-saxophone player Jarno Sarkula began AV as way to integrate more of an acoustic texture into their music, and the result is something of kick in the gut to traditional Finnish folk. Chiefly, where their country's odd-meter dances and tart, minor-chord hymns seem like the music of a lost mythology, AV injects a forceful, metallic dread into the forms. In addition to drums and sax, they feature pump organ and two cellos. This instrumentation might lead you to believe they play chamber music-- and on occasion they do, though when the cellos hit the distortion pedal, things get heavy, heads bang and all Valhalla breaks out.</p>\n<p><em>K\u00e4\u00e4rmelautakunta</em> is AV's second record, and makes a great case for them being the pre-eminent proponents of the supposed &quot;ethnic brass punk&quot; tag they give themselves. As far as I know, they're the only band actually playing this stuff, though in spirit at least, I can see valid comparisons to other European tricksters like Uz Jsme Doma or in their heavier moments, Scandinavian Black Metal. Still, the somber beauty in tracks like &quot;Vanha Iapsuudenyst\u00e4va&quot; makes clear these guys are no mere metal mongers. Piano and cellos begin the slow waltz with lilted, moaning figures that might pass as straight gypsy funeral music. One cello rises unto its upper register to take the melody, and when the percussion and saxophone enters, the tune's tragic, circus-orchestra melancholy is almost too much to take. AV has done a little soundtrack work, and I can very easily see this tune during the closing credits to a movie about the death of a shoemaker who moonlit as a mime for the czar.</p>\n<p>A subtle Klezmer influence works through some of the songs, such as the breakneck oompah of &quot;Lent\u00e4v\u00e4 Mato&quot; (or &quot;Flying Wyrm&quot;), to which I dare anyone to attempt to dance. The middle section is again reminiscent of some threepenny Eastern European melodrama best suited for sad clowns, but is quickly disintegrated by manic cymbal flares and the furious sax-led melody. &quot;Vasaraaasialainen&quot; (&quot;Vasar-Asian&quot;) is at once elegant and raw, with its buoyant pump organ and razor-sharp cello bassline. Sarkula's fanfare should sound familiar to anyone digging John Zorn's <em>Masada</em>, but rather than Semitic free jazz, the vibe here is pure Finnish ominous joy. The band drops away in the middle for a surprisingly gentle soliloquy of organ and cello, and returns with a bang right back to the dance. It's as celebratory, irresistible a moment of music as I've heard this year.</p>\n<p>The harsher passages on <em>K\u00e4\u00e4rmelautakunta</em>, such as the sludging menace of &quot;Kivitetty Saatana&quot; or relatively straightforward metal of &quot;Astiatehdas&quot; (&quot;Dish Factory&quot;) are actually the least engaging, if only because AV doesn't get to investigate their more subtle strengths. That said, just so you know, the closer &quot;J\u00e4\u00e4, Hyva Mieli&quot; will physically rip your neck from its shoulders if you get to close. I still want to check out Finland at some point, if only to soak in some of the culture that produces this stuff. Until then, AV comes very recommended.</p>\n",

That's sort of how Alan Braxe operates, I guess. Despite making some of the most robust and radiant disco-house of the last decade-- Gallic or otherwise-- he's never seemed to be one for fanfare. In the insular world of French house, he's like a mid-altitude cruiser to Daft Punk's twirling tandem airshow; dependable and always moving, but hardly the type to write his name in the sky.</p>\n<p>So, some background: Since debuting on Thomas Bangalter's seminal Roul\u00e9 imprint in 1997, Braxe (real name: Alan Queme) has casually tossed off a series of 12s that hit in the same league as Daft Punk's concurrent singles. But with the possible exception of last year's cokey synth anthem &quot;Rubicon&quot; and the definite exception of his co-sign on 1998's &quot;Music Sounds Better With You&quot;, chances are you won't recognize anything on <em>The Upper Cuts</em>. Even those who do might be caught a bit off guard, because it's easy to lose sight of Braxe's considerable talent when he's only issuing one new thing every six months; this widescreen snapshot of his work makes it impossible to forget just how good he is at what he does.</p>\n<p>Although billed as the work of Alan Braxe &amp; Friends so as to allow for the inclusion of occasional drop-ins like Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (with whom Braxe co-produced the aforementioned Stardust track), singer Benjamin Diamond (who sang on it), and little-known French crooner Romuald Louverjon (who comprised the other half of a short-lived outfit called The Paradise), the creative partnership at the heart of <em>The Upper Cuts is between Braxe and bassist Fred Falke. Together, the duo account for seven of the album's 12 tracks, and of those, only 2003's &quot;Love Lost&quot; is anything less than thrilling. The rest, from the glinting electro of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; to the staccato, fat-bottomed basslines of &quot;Palladium&quot; to the defiantly unfashionable 80s guitar peel of &quot;Rubicon&quot;, stack up one-by-one to mount a pretty convincing case for Braxe as French house's most slept-on producer.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to those seven cuts, the asthmatic coo of Paradise's dewey-eyed &quot;In Love With You&quot; and the Stardust track (which, I'm happy to say, is still great as ever) <em>The Upper Cuts contains one throwback, one remix, and one misstep. The throwback is Braxe's first ever release, 1997's &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and although it's dwarfed by his later material, it makes sense here, especially as a curtain closer. The remix is his spangly 2002 disco edit of Shakedown's &quot;At Night&quot; which is every bit as strong as his original material. (Braxe's remixing chops don't get often their proper due-- check out his versions of Annie's &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and Death From Above 1979's &quot;Black History Month&quot; for more.) The misstep is, unfortunately, the compilation's only track from 2005, a Braxe-produced Long Beach g-funk pastiche for a sorta hip-hop artist named Rec. It seems jokey and blunted and woefully out of sync with everything else here, and its presence makes the exclusion of &quot;Rubicon&quot; B-side &quot;Chrystal City&quot; even more confounding.</em></p>\n<p>By this point, though, I'm just tinkering, trying to find a way to make a V-8 supercar run a hundredth of a second faster.

                "en": "<p>On his debut album as Alaska in Winter, <em>Dance Party in the Balkans</em>, Brandon Bethancourt employed A Hawk and a Hacksaw's Heather Trost and Beirut's Zach Condon to flesh out his odd brand of vocoder-glazed indie pop. On that record, he managed to locate a middle ground between Balkan folk, Byzantine religious music, and the breakbeats rattling the trunks of his native Santa Fe. His aesthetic worked best at its extremes: the jittery beats of &quot;Balkan Lowrider Anthem&quot; at one pole, the hazy &quot;Lovely Lovely Love&quot; at the other. The middle range was pretty but equivocal, and Bethancourt came off like a talented pop musician slightly embarrassed by pop.</p>\n<p>But whatever obscurity prevailed upon <em>Dance Party in the Balkans</em> disperses on <em>Holiday</em>. It's a collection of chromed synth hymns aimed straight at your pleasure centers, with zero concessions to so-called difficulty. &quot;Berlin&quot; announces Bethancourt's newfound clarity and the place that fostered it (he spent six months making the album there): the synths are torqued into gleaming waves, the bassline is glued to the one-beat, and thwacking snares keep dropping in and out so we can relish the surge over and over.</p>\n<p>The Berlin microsound infiltrates the album only slightly; mostly, it's dominated by slabby 4/4 anthems. The locale's direct influence is more practical-- since Bethancourt had no instruments with him, his use of programmed synths and drums was compulsory. Because things like ukulele and vocals by Trost were added later, they never derail the rock-solid foundations as they sometimes did on the first album. Even the slightest song here, the ambivalently shuffling &quot;Knorrpromenade&quot;, packs almost as much wallop as <em>Dance Party</em>'s most emphatic moments.</p>\n<p>If Bethancourt's musical style is considerably refined on <em>Holiday</em>, his voice remains its centerpiece. He's still a dead ringer for Condon, although the minimization of folksy idioms helps him forge a more distinct identity of his own. He rolls out chorus after wafting chorus, harmonizing with his natural voice through a vocoder, thereby lending it a serrated edge. These are the kinds of songs that are impossible to sing without your eyes prayerfully closed, and Bethancourt's earnestness helps to sell his goofy lyrics about speed boats to heaven (on the splashy electro-pop nursery rhyme of the same name, an album highlight) and girls dying in his arms (on the percolating-then-gushing &quot;Highlander Pt. 1&quot;, a hammy tragi-romantic duet with Trost).</p>\n<p>Bethancourt likes to establish punchy patterns and flog them for all they're worth. The second part of &quot;Highlander&quot; brings in a new lyrical motif-- &quot;I don't want to live forever,&quot; he sings, rising and falling over each word-- but mostly sticks to reshuffling the scudding bass line, fizzy snares, and synth loops of its predecessor. The first two parts of &quot;Streetgang&quot; tinker with a buzzy theme that gains a powerful thrust with the introduction of trills and glossy chords in the song's third part. You can feel Bethancourt's enthusiasm, how he likes the parts so much he wants to see how they fit together in every possible permutation. Given the seductive simplicity of his loops, that enthusiasm is easy to share.</p>\n<p><em>Holiday</em> would be a fine album at any moment, but it seems especially timely right now. Let's take a quick inventory: The contours are stark and sleek, and it burns with a weirdly cold heat. The production is elaborate in a streamlined way, the melodies infectious. A sentimental digi-crooner is orbited by hums and blips, as if rendering your voice and music robotic gives you carte blanche to be messily human, even maudlin. Sound familiar? Suddenly, and just in time for the holidays, it's as if indie pop fans immune to the charms of Kanye West have an <em>808's and Heartbreak</em> of their very own.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Having a musician more famous than yourself appear on your record is a double-edged sword. Because Zach Condon of Beirut plays some trumpet and ukulele on Alaska in Winter's debut, it's gotten more blog hype than an album by a unfamiliar musician on a little-known label would traditionally merit. This is a boon, because <em>Dance Party in the Balkans</em> is subtle and idiosyncratic in a way that doesn't align with modern popular indie music's gravity and bombast. It's quite likely that this fine album would've been overlooked if not for Condon's cameos.</p>\n<p>The downside of having a built-in blog hook on your album is that, while you'll get more exposure, it will often focus solely on a dubious interpretation of this hook. One wonders if Alaska in Winter auteur Brandon Bethancourt has come to regret asking Condon, his childhood friend (not to mention Beirut collaborator Heather Trost), to play on the record, effectively branding it as a Beirut side-project in exchange for more album sales.</p>\n<p>Of course, the one song on the album that sounds really Beiruty, the drippy anthem &quot;Close Your Eyes-- We Are Blind&quot;, has garnered the most attention so far. It's an anomaly, and I'll take the sputtering, richly-harmonized electro of &quot;The Homeless and the Hummingbirds&quot;, the sprightly piano ballad &quot;Your Red Dress (Wedding Song at Cemetery)&quot;, or the thunderous box-step of &quot;Rain on Every Weekend&quot; over it any day. While Bethancourt and Condon share a fondness for woozy brass and sinuous gypsy strains, their music is drastically different at structural and aesthetic levels.</p>\n<p><em>Dance Party in the Balkans</em> hybridizes a far-flung variety of forms into chilly, beat-oriented, downtempo hymns: amorous Balkan strings, the melismatic vocal tapestries of classical Arabian music (often so gently vocoder-kissed as to sound more spectral than robotic), icily splintered piano loops (which are actually played live), skittering hip-hop percussion (ditto), and soaringly simple indie pop melodies obscured in an atmospheric haze. The voices droning through the splashy percussion and glacial pianos of &quot;Twenty Four Hours in Lake of Ice&quot; sound like they haven't seen the sun in some time, a semse that persists through the more abstract, less rhythmic half of the songs.</p>\n<p>It's difficult to overemphasize the pervasive chill that hovers, paradoxically, around the album's warm melodies: Even its most luridly romantic moments sound remote and contemplative. The unfortunately-titled &quot;Lovely Lovely Love&quot; is such a moment, and among the record's highlights: a swelling, non-instrumental sound-alike of Imogen Heap's &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; for the indie rock set. Where Condon's voice soars over Beirut's music, Bethancourt's nestles into his own, which partially explains the chilliness. Also, he recorded most of the music in Alaska, in winter, before returning to New Mexico to flesh it out. After you check out the Iditarod and the aurora borealis, there's not much to do besides hole up with your music and think about how freaking cold it is.</p>\n<p>The album's resistance to pop structures is another key to its aloofness-- instead, the arrangements tend toward the incantatory, the fugal, the intuitive drive forward. Hooks last for entire songs (see the tense, cyclical piano figure undergirding the lyrical strings on &quot;Balkan Lowrider Anthem&quot;) or never appear at all (see the stately dirge &quot;The Beautiful Burial Flowers We Will Never See&quot;), lending a sense of gusty expanse to an album pinioned by taut rhythms. This is suburban low-riding music at its most self-aware: a far cry from Beirut's guitar-intensive chamber music.</p>\n",

Physically, their impossibly wan expressions work overtime to contrast their black-hole locks, suggesting brooding dichromatic cartoon characters. And their hammer-to-the-head blunt takes on Nietzsche and nihilism are equally cartoonish; such stunted ideas of death, destruction, and anarchy are as awe-inspiring to wayward teens as they are laughable to about everyone else.</p>\n<p>Both skinny puppies spent the 1990s pushing industrial music in new, sometimes striking directions only to run out of black nail polish near the turn of the century. Similarly, the duo released bloated double albums a few years ago only to come back in the last few months with stripped-down, self-consciously &quot;raw&quot; follow-ups. After taking industrial to its logical noise-soaked endpoint, Empire struggles on his misleadingly titled <em>Futurist, which eschews his forward-thinking dancefloor-clearing breakbeats and Eno-style ambient ramblings for a more up-front punk approach. Though he's still scowling and screaming with verve, the traditional song structures and relatively mild rock production unfortunately puts more emphasis on his straight-faced, literal-as-fuck lyrics.</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Kiss of Death&quot; is the first and best track on the record, with the following 11 songs relegated to less inspired versions of the same Pistols-meets-KMFDM formula. The guitars dominate the mix throughout, their power chord fury nearly matching Empire's corrosive, distorted vocal. &quot;<em>I'm Here to stay!!! You better watch out cuz I came to terminate!!!!&quot; he sings with genuine, if somewhat pathetic, passion (capitalization and punctuation based on his official site, natch). For any other artist, the track would be considered quite breakneck but compared to his own brand of television-static cocaine-jungle, &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; is almost midtempo. The three-chord simplicity is admirable and refreshing at first, though it quickly starts to wear thin in all respects.</em></p>\n<p>It's easy to poke fun at Alec's somewhat lost-in-translation goth-gangster pose, but for all his anti-establishment hollering, Empire's mantras often come off as a tad militaristic in their repetitive simplicity. On the monotonous &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, it's not enough to repeat the title over and over (and over), he even goes on to explain it, in case you were confused: &quot;You can't go back even if you wanted to.&quot; There's reinforcing the humorless German stereotype and then, it seems, there's Alec Empire.</p>\n<p>When wrapped in confrontational music that matches his unwavering hatred of &quot;the man,&quot; Empire can be enthralling but <em>Futurist</em>'s sordid punk suggests our man may have cornered himself. Now in his 30s, this black-clad fist-pumper has always been at his best when taking into account all of his industrial influences, from Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten to Ministry, and spewing them out in brain-cell-crushing odes to nothingness. <em>Futurist</em>, with its muddy, one-note punk-thrash revivalism that belies his talents as a versatile studio auteur, is as frustratingly unremarkable and immobile as the governments he so blatantly rails against.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Listening to <em>The Lateness of the Hour</em>, I try to hear <a href=\"http://www.alexclare.com/\">Alex Clare</a>, but mostly end up seeing a hat. A fedora, to be specific. Always front and center in the mix, Clare's voice drips with the brassy confidence and implied stylistic reverence of post-Mark Ronson ladies' men like Bruno Mars, Wallpaper, and Mayer Hawthorne, artists who seem to exist solely to don fancy duds in men's magazines that congratulate them for doing absolutely nothing to upset the concept of how this stuff should sound and look-- soul music as a fashion accessory, mostly.</p>\n<p>The difference with Clare is that the young Brit is being produced by Diplo and Switch and it all feels icky in a way any album does when it comes off like a record exec's version of Listerine, something that invents both the problem and the solution. This year, the likes of James Blake, Jamie Woon, Katy B, and to a certain extent SBTRKT have all made strides in satisfying those who'd prefer the fluidity and innovation of dubstep and UK bass music be delivered by knowable singer-songwriters. It was basically the same issue that people had when trying to monetize electronica over a decade ago, and <em>Lateness</em> offers up the same one-step fix: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXd6u9o6dYY\">Keep it goin' louder</a>.</p>\n<p>But the idea that this is even a proper forum for discussing the purity of the form gets decimated in less than three-minutes with opener &quot;Up All Night&quot;. Major Lazer too minimal and chaste for your blood? How do you feel about Arctic Monkeys guitar chug with dancehall beats and that almost-rap cadence from &quot;Wannabe&quot;? In its quest for confluence with lyrics that play out like a longform Bacardi ad, it's a tidy summary in how the hedonism of pop radio can feel so predatory these days. (Or you'll end up with a justified worry that Major Lazer's collaboration with No Doubt will end up sounding like <em>Transistor</em>-era 311.)</p>\n<p>From there, <em>Lateness</em> never does much to prove Clare and his producers were on the same page (let alone reading from the same book). Clare's songs are perfectly innocuous and only occasionally irritating transmissions from the mindset of the modern pop&amp;B male, oversinging underwritten come-ons to either the woman who got away (&quot;Humming Bird&quot;), the woman who <em>won</em>'<em>t</em> get away if he's got anything to say about it (&quot;Relax My Beloved&quot;), or failing that, her fine-ass friend (&quot;Treading Water&quot;). The line, &quot;I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe/ At the end of all you're still my best friend,&quot; basically reveals the borders of his worldview.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that Diplo and Switch are producing like they don't need Clare's voice and he's singing like he doesn't want their production. The high-NRG drums and sandworm synth lines hardly sound like necessary or even complementary additions to &quot;Treading Water&quot;-- an &quot;unplugged&quot; version is helpfully included on the Deluxe Edition if you doubt me. Likewise, the caricatured deep bass on &quot;Relax My Beloved&quot; and the gospel-via-T.D. Jakes gaudiness of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; are nice tricks that may make you wonder if Diplo and Switch will regret not saving them for someone who'd actually appreciate the details. As the second half drags on, Clare tries to muster some grit into terribly sappy love jams with self-explanatory titles like &quot;Love You&quot;, &quot;I Won't Let You Down&quot;, and &quot;Where Is the Heart?&quot; making you wonder if <em>Lateness</em> is essentially a Ray LaMontagne record with beats.</p>\n<p>Then comes the cover of &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. He's almost certainly aware of the talking points-- not just the supposed audacity of trying one's hand at such an acknowledged and shopworn classic, but in how it fits on a record with such an exaggerated low end when Prince famously removed bass entirely. Like most of <em>Lateness,</em> though, it's more eye-rolling than pernicious. (You could argue &quot;Tight Rope&quot; is a worse crime for revealing Clare has clearly never heard of Janelle Mon\u00e1e, taking the central metaphor from her song of the same name wholesale and nothing else worthwhile.)</p>\n<p>Truth is, it's much easier getting mad at the marketing plan of <em>Lateness of the Hour</em> than the record itself: The total mismatch of artistic motivation makes everyone involved come off like innocent bystanders, not manipulators. Call it <em>GQ</em> funky, <a href=\"http://www.ralphlauren.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2885938\">Purple Label</a> Sound, How To Dress Well (For Real) or whatever... I mean, you play this thing on iTunes and Genius recommends a &quot;similar&quot; song called &quot;Rocket To Uranus&quot; by Vengaboyz and Perez Hilton. Well done, all involved.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In the Web 2.0 era, the successor to the concept album seems to be its user-generated counterpart, the mix CD. But for DJ and music video director Alex Moulton, the two aren't mutually exclusive. As the founder of media production house Expansion Team, Moulton lords over scores of tightly wound marketing storylines for corporate clients like Target and McDonald's. His debut full-length <em>Exodus</em> gives him the freedom to confront those filmic aspects while wearing his DJ hat. With <em>Exodus</em>, Moulton constructs an instrumental science-fiction adventure that, unencumbered by lingual constraints, functions as a narrative mirror, its proggy signifiers pursuing only an obsessive sense of escapism.</p>\n<p>The single visual that accompanies <em>Exodus</em>, its cover, depicts such a sci-fi scene: A shirtless stud holds a damsel in distress, both suspended in time, frozen in flight from a fiery cityscape. The CD's label is a mockup of printed vinyl grooves. And from the first stabs of Moog arpeggios cutting across &quot;Overture&quot;, the proverbial laser-stringed harp of Jean-Michel Jarre looms large. Moulton said of <em>Exodus</em>: &quot;I wanted to make something like a Pink Floyd record, where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey.&quot; The nostalgia that he invokes is clearly the kind that imagined an analogue future.</p>\n<p>However, Moulton's idea of psychedelia is more Tangerine Dream's Klaus Schulze than Floyd's Roger Waters, embracing the Berlin school knob-twiddler conflict between man and machine rather than any Cambridge or Canterbury absurdity. In the course of <em>Exodus</em>, he bounces between his retro muse and one of its fast-forwarded descendents, filter disco, and the shadows of Daft Punk and Alan Braxe appear out of his gauzy synthesized lines in &quot;Out of Phase&quot;, &quot;Meridians&quot;, and &quot;Paradise&quot;. Just as often, however, his dance beats give way to live drums and even tribal rhythms. Interludes play a central role in Moulton's story, linking nightclubby action scenes, otherworldly jungle chases (&quot;The Sacrifice&quot;) and somber love themes (&quot;Together Again&quot;). Indeed, the mood changes so drastically and so often-- nearly every song-- that it's sometimes hard to feel in tune with his greater conceit.</p>\n<p>That's one of the reasons why <em>Exodus</em> leaves so many unanswered questions. &quot;Exodus&quot; sounds like the climactic battle, and the final two cuts, &quot;Ad Astra&quot; (&quot;to the stars&quot; in Latin) and &quot;L'Arc en Ciel&quot; (&quot;the rainbow&quot; in French) hint at some sort of romantic transcendence, but Moulton leaves the details up to the listener. As its conceptual cousin <em>Interstella 5555</em> visually depicted, the success of an otherworldly storyline can't mask the awkward realities of his medium. <em>Exodus</em>'s 14 tracks and 68 minutes rise and fall like 14 little films, with the larger narrative rising almost exclusively from the songs' shared analog antiquity. Moulton's concept falters when the listener tries to piece these sensory experiences into a linear progression, but <em>Exodus</em> is still a fascinating and problematic listen as a whole. It's the individual works, however, that emerge as the stars of their own little show. In that sense, Moulton has not only met his goal of the simultaneous concept album and DJ mix-- he's exceeded it by light years.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Glaswegian producer/DJ Alex Smoke (aka Alex Menzies) has never made techno you were supposed to dance to. In his more than decade-long career, his mixes and productions have veered far from the main drag of club and dancefloor appeal. More important for Smoke, in all of his work, was emotional exploration.\u00a0It\u2019s obvious that he has the disposition of a sensitive soul, and on his first outing with <a href=\"http://www.rsrecords.com/\">R&amp;S Records</a>, <em>Love Over Will</em>, Smoke swings for the fences, trying to complete a vision which could really create a puncturing and memorable experience.</p>\n<p>Apparently the title of the album is a playful inversion of British occultist Aleister Crowley\u2019s law of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema\">Thelema</a>, a thoroughly ambiguous holy writ. In similarly opaque and broad terms, Smoke has described the album as &quot;a statement on the times we are living in, but with an optimism relating to ways forward that are possible.&quot; But does he deliver on such lofty statements? Probably not, but in over 13 tracks and 33 minutes, Smoke tightly packs a myriad of concepts and ideas, ranging from ontology, loss love, the carceral state, and Edward Snowden. The resulting project is contemplative, relaxing, and elegant on a sonic level, but often uneven and clunky lyrically.</p>\n<p>The unevenness comes from Smoke\u2019s heavy reliance on his singing, which cannot carry the album's thematic weight. \u00a0His vocals dominate, featuring in eight of the 13 songs. Throughout, he sings in a low register, mostly in a monotone, and his voice is always Auto-Tuned or pitch-adjusted. Sometimes the vocals are the perfect complement to his sparse, buoyant productions, and at other times they are far too brittle and inflexible to match the rich sounds around him. The freezingly tender and liquid wall of sound in the album\u2019s opener, &quot;Fair Is Foul,&quot; favorably recalls\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/23356-mica-levi/\">Mica Levi</a>\u2019s palette of quavering synths for <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/\">Under the Skin</a></em>, but the track is nearly ruined by the\u00a0interjection of lines like &quot;I never really care about you anyway/ You\u2019re always on the way.&quot;</p>\n<p>When his songwriting and singing fit together, Smoke comes very close to the emotional resonance he is striving for. In &quot;LossGain,&quot; as he whispers &quot;Don\u2019t tell me how I feel when I\u2019m myself,&quot; there is an aching sense of strength and affirmation amidst the melancholy. When he sings &quot;All my atoms/ Struggling to fight them&quot; in &quot;All My Atoms,&quot; the blunt lyrics propel the energy of the song\u2019s bright keys. Smoke is a sentimentalist at heart, and in the album\u2019s best track, &quot;Dust,&quot; he submits to old desires and calls out to a lover: &quot;Don\u2019t want to be with anyone else/ Don\u2019t want to be separate.&quot;</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/\">Holly Herndon</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/\">Jam City</a>, Smoke attempts to politically radicalize his music. Unlike the other two artists, he is hesitant to go full hog, and only devotes two tracks to explicitly political themes: &quot;Fall Out&quot; and &quot;Yearning Mississippi.&quot; &quot;Fall Out&quot; is partially inspired by the trials and tribulations of hacker folk hero Edward Snowden. As he sings &quot;you\u2019ll never know they\u2019re watching you...you\u2019ll never even see,&quot; his voice is drowned out by a landscape of computer sounds, not unlike the ones featured in Laura Poitras' film about Snowden, <em>Citizenfour</em>. As the album\u2019s final track, it serves as an almost cheerful acquiescence to the grand scariness of the surveillance state, in favor of ruminating on less dizzying concerns. For &quot;Yearning Mississippi,&quot; he explored ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax\u2019s <a href=\"http://research.culturalequity.org/get-audio-ix.do?ix=session&amp;id=PR47&amp;idType=abbrev&amp;sortBy=abc\">Cultural Equity Archive </a>and sampled prison songs from Mississippi. This is an interesting detail, but it would be impossible to notice on its own, making the potential critique of the prison system miss its mark.</p>\n<p>Overall, Smoke still gets over on his ability to craft rich, moody soundscapes, although almost all the tracks on the album would have worked better as standalone instrumentals. Unlike his last project, <em>Wraetlic</em>, a woefully dreary and depressive piece, <em>Love Over Will</em>\u00a0projects a hopeful sense of growth for Smoke. The sadness here is somehow more buoyant and more comforting. It leaves a kernel of warmth on otherwise very cold days.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Alex Smoke makes electronic music that runs counter to virtually every prevailing trend. More interestingly, there are very few moments during the last decade-plus that this statement wouldn't be mostly true. The Scottish producer crafts dark, ornate music that seems intentionally at odds with electronic music's current fixation on luminescent house sounds; he has a reputation for minimalism, but his productions seem too roiling to slot into whatever sounds that word represents. Dubstep is similarly deep and ominous, but Smoke sounds steely and focused, not foggy and stoned. On his third album, <em>Lux</em>, he again uses tough arpeggios, mumbled vocals, and furrowed percussion to enact mini-dramas of industrial techno.</p>\n<p>Though <em>Lux</em> can evoke comforting sadness, its orchestral bent and general meticulousness keep it from ever feeling truly despairing. So the album offers these small perversions of mood without becoming overbearing. Because he obscures his voice and has a reputation for making complete albums (as opposed to singles), Smoke's work has been compared to Thom Yorke's solo outing, <em>The Eraser</em>. While both share an affinity for the hardscrabble rhythms of mid-1990s IDM, Smoke's compositions are less linear and song-oriented. The 14 tracks on <em>Lux</em> often stretch past six minutes, but Smoke doesn't build to climaxes so much as sniff out every corner of his creations.</p>\n<p><em>Lux</em> is Smoke's least motive album yet-- only the most generous definitions of &quot;dance&quot; would include this music-- but these tracks don't idle, they prowl. When Smoke increases the tempos-- the thrumming &quot;Blingkered&quot;, the lite-rave of &quot;Pilk&quot;-- his songs sound tense, not celebratory. You can connect the lurching &quot;Physic&quot; or &quot;Lux+&quot; to Hyperdub's smeared sound attacks, but minus the exposed-nerve bass. <em>Lux</em> occasionally sounds like Coil's snake-y masterpiece, <em>Love</em>'<em>s Secret Domain</em>, but that album alluded to sex and drugs (or maybe druggy sex), and Alex Smoke seems chiefly concerned with Alex Smoke.</p>\n<p>More than anything, <em>Lux</em> feels self-contained: produced by a single artist and released on Smoke's own Hum + Haw imprint, it projects dark vistas that feel deeply personal. Unlike many techno artists, Smoke builds his albums for sitdown sessions (EPs containing floor-friendly versions of &quot;Lux+&quot; and &quot;Blingkered&quot; are already available) and has seemingly little concern for where these dense, thoughtful behemoths fit in a broader context. Forunately, <em>Lux</em> needs little besides an accommodating, stormy mindset for its hum and shiver to make sense.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In a pop landscape filled with cartoonish characters and alter-egos, the first refreshing thing about New Yorker <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/alexwinston\">Alex Winston</a> is her name. Confidence in her own skin is something Winston revels in and turns into her most powerful weapon on her debut record,\u00a0<em>King Con</em>. Her songs are undeniably poppy and well-produced but reject the ice-cream gloss or ambiguity of many other contemporary pop artists. Instead there's a homespun feel here, and the layered production is stuffed with detail and component parts. It's an approach that makes the songs feel driven on piston power rather than Pro Tools.</p>\n<p>Her voice is full of quirks, too, and more often than not she sounds closer to more alternative singers such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xckBwPdo1c\">Kate Bush</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcHjAUhtSrk\">Joanna Newsom</a>, or even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfcBwYuNDU\">Karen O</a>. Transplanting imperfect, personality-rich influences like this to a set of powerful pop songs is an interesting move and one that mostly pays off on <em>King Con</em>.</p>\n<p>The sound that opens &quot;Velvet Elvis&quot; is a worn, gently warping vinyl stuck in a groove. This nostalgia wash acts as the bedrock for the busier elements that join the scuffle before bursting into a typically big chorus. Winston's narratives here and elsewhere feel just out of reach; they're fantastical but never come across as forced. That's thanks in part to the infectious feeling of excitement she gives off in each her performances. There's no hint of irony on <em>King Con</em>. There is a lot of heart, though, and there's something to be said for that in a realm of music where it's easy to feel manipulated. (That's not to say Winston doesn't pull some strings of her own. The togetherness in songs like &quot;Medicine&quot; and &quot;Host&quot; echoes the &quot;us-versus-them&quot; anthemic sway of a band like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWgmRvwR0a8\">Arcade Fire</a>.)</p>\n<p>Despite being over a year old, &quot;Locomotive&quot; still feels like a highlight amongst this set, and the song hasn't changed a lot since <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12114-locomotive/\">we wrote about it last February</a>. The edges have been heated up a little, and if anything Winston sounds even looser and more idiosyncratic. The song's feverish momentum is both a high point and vital characteristic of <em>King Con</em>, where each victory feels hard won.</p>\n<p>The downside to the relentless energy is that the record can get tiring, particularly after the impressive, but front-loaded first half. &quot;Benny&quot; is the only restrained moment here; even that feels too brief and comes too late. A large part of <em>King Con</em>'s charm is its confidence in direction, but toward the end, the sheer weight of similarly paced songs ends up dragging it down. For the most part, though, <em>King Con</em>'s an enjoyable collection, one that presents Winston as an artist with a strong enough personality to overcome that dip and to stand out in a scene where it can be hard to make an impression.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>On his third proper solo album, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/\">Alexis Taylor</a> puts aside all semblance of pop affectations in favor of something totally sparse and infinitely more vulnerable: a record composed entirely of piano and voice. Recorded at Hackney Road Studios, the aptly-named <em>Piano</em> is not only the most straightforward thing the usually cheeky <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/\">Hot Chip</a> frontman\u00a0has ever released, it\u2019s also the most surprisingly personal. Taylor has always had a knack for embedding wistfulness and bittersweet melancholia into pristinely rendered pop songs. With <em>Piano</em> Taylor peels back any kind of artifice, offering a collection of songs that examine mortality, religion, and the creative impulse itself.</p>\n<p>The album opens with \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d\u2014a song that correlates the creative process with a kind of expansive emotional openness. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I\u2019m ready?\u201d sings Taylor. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I\u2019m healthy? Nowhere else I\u2019d rather be/Nothing to protect me/No one to defend me.\u201d The song, which is carried aloft by Taylor\u2019s lovely but unfussy piano playing, speaks to vulnerability at the core of the record. The idea of emotional nakedness as reflected by this sort of stripped back, bare-bones performance style is certainly nothing new, but it\u2019s a conceit that works nicely here, showcasing just how genuinely sweet Taylor\u2019s voice actually is. This is particularly true on the record\u2019s two standout covers\u2014a take on Artie Glenn\u2019s \u201cCrying in the Chapel\u201d (a song made famous by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/\">Elvis</a> in 1965) and, even more odd and sublime, a gorgeous version of Crystal Gayle\u2019s 1977 hit, \u201cDon\u2019t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue.\u201d Stripped of its more obvious gospel tropes, the former plays like a love song to serenity, a paean for the peace that comes with surrendering to a higher power or some great love. With his quietly non-ironic dissection of the latter, Taylor gets to the sticky emotional core of Gayle\u2019s song\u2014i.e. the pain of being tossed aside for someone else\u2014and delivers it with devastating ease: \u201cTell me you love me and don\u2019t let me cry/Say anything but don\u2019t say goodbye.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of the original songs on <em>Piano,</em> the most interesting of the lot are oblique examinations of spirituality, all rendered from the stance of the unbeliever. \u201cIn the Light of the Room\u201d and \u201cI Never Lock That Door\u201d each unspool with the rhythms of an old country song or a hymn, the divinity at their centers less about any specific god but rather sourced from a sense of love, goodness, and wholeness that exists only in the abstract. (\u201cThere\u2019s one place that\u2019s always open/And you\u2019ll find me if you\u2019re hoping/to be mine for all of time/I never lock that door.\u201d) In the liner notes for <em>Piano</em> Taylor admits that many of these songs are meant to \u201ccelebrate lives of friends now passed, as well as love for those closest to us, and music itself.\u201d On the elegiac \u201cSo Much Further to Go\u201d Taylor balances the urge to bring something new into the world against the crushing brevity of human experience, describing life itself as \u201ca\u00a0miracle that's hard to bear,\u201d while on album-closing \u201cDon\u2019t Worry\u201d he intones, \u201cIf I\u2019m gone away, don\u2019t worry/It is only forever\u201d as if to remind us that life is short, but also sometimes unbearably and stupidly long.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to dismiss\u00a0<em>Piano</em> as a slight addition to Taylor\u2019s discography, but that would be wrong. The quiet humanity in these songs is disarmingly simple at first, but these sentiments creep up on you, giving credence to the notion that it\u2019s in these private moments of contemplation where the narratives of our lives are ultimately assembled. \u201cIn the light of the room/Through a window dappled/I was dreaming of you/And of all that\u2019s happened,\u201d Taylor sings on \u201cIn the Light of the Room.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of simple moment of observation that <em>Piano</em> is full of. Taylor is no stranger to wearing his heart on his sleeve, <em>Piano</em> takes that notion one step further\u2014 it\u2019s as if Taylor is taking his heart out for everyone to see, then discreetly leaving it on your coffee table.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In between creating albums of indelible, secretly smart dance-pop, the members of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/\">Hot Chip</a>\u00a0have indulged in solo projects that focus on specific aspects of the band\u2019s sound. These projects are sometimes reminiscent of Hot Chip, while almost always stopping short of the band's classic sound. Both on his own and as part of house-loving duo <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28740-the-2-bears/\">the 2 Bears</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8594-joe-goddard/\">Joe Goddard</a> has explored the group's beat-driven, clubby side, while Al Doyle and Felix Martin have zeroed in on dance\u2019s comedown moments, first with the stately, short-lived Lanark (whose elegant \u201cThe Stone the Builder Rejected\u201d appeared on Hot Chip\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10250-dj-kicks/\"><em>DJ-Kicks</em></a> mix from 2007) and then as part of the more downtempo <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29934-new-build/\">New Build</a> project.</p>\n<p>Similar to Goddard, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/\">Alexis Taylor</a> also works on his own and as part of a group, releasing two records over the past three years with his avant-pop outfit <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28299-about/\">About Group</a>, which also features members of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat\">This Heat</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/\">Spiritualized</a>. Without hearing a note of music, the group\u2019s collective pedigree suggests that their music might be more difficult than Hot Chip\u2019s glimmering, weird accessibility\u2014indeed, they initially came together in 2009 to record an under-the-radar record of improvisational music. But although their music has lacked immediacy, it still hews closely to traditional songwriting forms, merging the yacht-rock predilections that have cropped up on Taylor-sung Hot Chip songs with a soft-focus songwriting approach reminiscent of one-time Taylor collaborator <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/\">Robert Wyatt</a>.</p>\n<p>Taylor\u2019s solo work doesn\u2019t so much diverge from his work in About Group as it does resemble a more isolated version of that band\u2019s loosely drawn style, slotting abstract sound experiments alongside simple songs that lean on a one main hook. (About Group is definitely the main reference point for Taylor\u2019s solo endeavors; other than that solemnly gorgeous, church-like voice of his, his own material is so far removed from the Hot Chip canon that it barely resembles the band\u2019s work at all.) <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12460-rubbed-out/\"><em>Rubbed Out</em></a>\u00a0from 2008 carried a cheeky title that doubled as an explanation for the record\u2019s off-the-cuff sound (\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any thinking behind it, really,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/hot-chip/40482\"><em>NME</em></a> at the time) and last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17488-nayim-from-the-halfway-line/\"><em>Nayim from the Halfway Line</em></a> EP leaned hard on experimentation, serving as a depository for stray ideas. His latest solo effort, <em>Await Barbarians</em>, kicks off with a red herring to suggest that the listener\u2019s in for more of the same: the two-minute \u201cLazy Bones\u201d is all aimlessly plunked tones, with the occasional pitch-bend that gives the track a first-time-using-a-keyboard feel.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the slight piece of music isn\u2019t representative of what follows, instead acting as a portal for an intimate collection of home-recorded, structurally melodic songs. Much of <em>Await Barbarians</em> is intrinsically catchy, in the way that most simple, basically pleasing melodies will get stuck in your head after one or two listens. Part of this is due to Taylor\u2019s honeyed vocals, which could make even a takeout menu sound exquisitely melancholy, but the highlights suggest that Taylor\u2019s capable of writing engaging songs even on his own. \u201cWithout a Crutch\u201d, the melody and title of which appears twice on <em>Await Barbarians</em>, sways and swings with warm instrumentation that could make for a serviceable sitcom theme song; the dusky, anti-gravity pull of \u201cImmune System\u201d resembles a stripped-down take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/\">OMD</a>\u2019s more downtempo moments, while the main melodic figure of \u201cAm I Not a Soldier?\u201d gently cascades on a bed of dry drum machine hits and slow-hand guitar.</p>\n<p>Much of Hot Chip\u2019s music has gives back whatever feelings the listener puts into it; that is to say, they\u2019re not the most direct band lyrically, and even at their most personal they maintain a distance. In the closing moments of 2012\u2019s kaleidoscopic <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/\"><em>In Our Heads</em></a>, Taylor briefly broke that spell with the moony-eyed devotional \u201cAlways Been Your Love\u201d, but on <em>Await Barbarians</em> he seems to have retreated back into his shell again, to the point where when he sings \u201cEveryone knows what I mean\u201d over the jagged guitar of \u201cFrom the Halfway Line\u201d, it seems like he\u2019s having a laugh. Wit has certainly played a large role in Hot Chip\u2019s work, especially their earlier records, and on <em>Await Barbarians</em> a sense of humor occasionally rears its head. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know where I am today/ It\u2019s not because I\u2019m far away,\u201d he jauntily sings on the album\u2019s first iteration of \u201cWithout a Crutch\u201d, following it up with a sorry-not-sorry sense of defeatism: \u201cOr even \u2018cause I drink too much/ Or then again, not quite enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Listen hard enough and a few other glimmers of fascination eventually rise out of the album\u2019s low-stakes murk\u2014tucked away in the funereal march of \u201dElvis Has Left the Building\u201d is what could possibly be a strange allusion to Whitney Houston\u2019s passing in 2011. But the downtempo trudge and repetitive structures of <em>Await Barbarians</em> are ultimately too imposing to demand the close attention they require. And that\u2019s okay: at his best, Taylor has sounded like someone caught up in the rapture of self, a beatific presence unconcerned with what\u2019s around him, so a solo album made by himself and <em>for</em> himself isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. Given what he\u2019s proven capable of as part of his main gig, though, it\u2019s hard not to wish that, when left to his own devices, he made more of an effort to get outside of his own head.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/\">Hot Chip</a> singer and multi-instrumentalist <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/\">Alexis Taylor</a> appears locked in a constant battle to shake off any form of stasis. He <a href=\"http://www.ldwt.net/2012/07/don%E2%80%99t-deny-your-heart-hot-chip/\">talked</a> of the value in working on musical projects outside his main band during the promo stint for last year's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/\"><em>In Our Heads</em></a>, highlighting how it positively affected the songwriting on that album. Taylor's an enviable musician who gives the impression that he could turn his hand to just about anything if he tried. Even one of his side projects, the low-key collection of musicians who record under the name <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28299-about/\">About Group</a>, have sucked in an impressively broad array of styles over the course of two albums. In 2008 Taylor released <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12460-rubbed-out/\"><em>Rubbed Out</em></a>, a full-length solo record grazed by rough production values and, on occasion, a C-86-like slackness to the playing. It felt like he was enjoying the deliberate looseness after spending so long on the tightly wound constructions Hot Chip create, and that feeling of shaking off the slightly stuffy studio creations of his main band has become something of a theme to his work elsewhere. Listen closely enough and you may even hear the sound of Taylor pumping air into the studio through a gigantic set of billows.</p>\n<p><em>Nayim from the Halfway Line</em> is a further progression for Taylor's work away from Hot Chip. There's nothing here as starkly confessional as &quot;I Love My Home&quot; from <em>Rubbed Out</em> or his surprisingly fresh take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/\">Paul McCartney</a>'s &quot;Coming Up&quot; from the same album. Instead, it's Taylor hopping back and forth over the line he's drawn between Hot Chip and his other output. The sense of organization and efficiency that his other band practices is more present here-- it's less demo-y and spontaneous than either <em>Rubbed Out</em> or About Group. None of the four tracks are soccer-themed, but the title is a nod to the Spanish player Nayim, who scored a spectacular <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsbBSj4vm30\">goal</a> for Real Zaragoza in the last minute of a match against Arsenal in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners Cup Final. The ball arcs in the air with just the right weight behind it, Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman is caught off his line, and Nayim achieves immortality from a moment of rare beauty. There's no obvious link between that incident and the music here, but it does further emphasize Taylor's less earnest approach to the presentation of his non-Hot Chip material.</p>\n<p>The title lies in stark contrast to the contents inside. There's a familiarly bookish approach to clubland that pervades throughout, matched to the kind of suffocatingly dense production values that make it feel like everything has been labored over a little too long. That doesn't prevent moments of inspiration from arising, it's just that too often they're dragged down by hackneyed devices such as pitch-shifted vocal passages (&quot;Rhodes Dream&quot;) and small loops left to echo into eternity in an attempt at creating ambience (&quot;Jesus' Birthday&quot;). The sense of departure that resonates throughout his other non-Hot Chip work is strangely absent. &quot;You Want Me&quot; even sounds like it could've been a track that didn't make the cut on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/\"><em>One Life Stand</em></a>, although that's not necessarily a bad place to be, especially when Taylor glides into a smooth synth odyssey in its final third. It feels like a step back to the kind of improvisation that lit up his other work away from his main band, momentarily returning to the sense of freedom and release entrenched in those recordings.</p>\n<p>The overriding feeling of this EP is one of finding a home for loose ideas that had been hanging around for a while. It's too bad Taylor couldn't find more room for his reedy, utterly soulful vocal passages, such as the ones that briefly light up &quot;Hot Squash&quot;. He's got the kind of voice that can easily transcend the trite sentimentality that sometimes infects his writing. On &quot;Hot Squash&quot; he can even get away with singing: &quot;Years I've been waiting, waiting too long/ years I've been waiting, now you've gone.&quot; Imbuing lines like that with palpable emotion and setting them to tight pop structures are Taylor's forte, it's just that here they tail off into squawking wah-wah guitar and redundant analog synth bloops, leaving this EP caught somewhere between genuine inspiration and a mess of fumbling in the dark. Similarly, Nayim's titular goal could be argued over as a piece of supreme skill and judgement or a blind hit-and-hope moment. Here, the latter just about wins out over the former.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>After a promising debut (<em>Coming on Strong</em>) and a definitive sophomore album (<em>The Warning</em>), Hot Chip found themselves in a position similar to Radioheard's circa <em>Hail to the Thief</em>-- painted into the corner of their own distinct aesthetic on this year's <em>Made in the Dark</em>. This impasse is the ideal moment for band members to make\u00a0low-key solo albums focusing on the core elements that make their bands great, just as Thom Yorke did with <em>The Eraser</em>.</p>\n<p>Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor does just that on <em>Rubbed Out</em>, a refreshingly simple collection of tender ballads and quirky set pieces. It often feels like catching Hot Chip songs half-formed-- it's easy to imagine how they'd shape up with syncopated percussion and filter sweeps, and many of them are so striking that you might wish for similarly stripped-down versions of &quot;Boy From School&quot; and &quot;Look After Me&quot;. The sentiment veers between giddy infatuation and discreet heartbreak, but the mood stays quietly devotional throughout. Taylor's voice hovers over rich keyboard smears or bounces lightly over tripping guitars, accented with little bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>The hooks come hard and fast over <em>Rubbed Out</em>'s delightful first two-thirds. &quot;Fireworks&quot;, an engaging squelch-and-static instrumental, serves as a quick warm-up for &quot;Plastic Man&quot;, a winsome organ hymn on which Taylor sings unabashedly about &quot;the heart that is inside of me.&quot; A fluttering electric guitar version of Paul McCartney's &quot;Coming Up&quot; follows, and by the time you get to the hopscotch-pop of &quot;Baby&quot;, you'll be charmed. Other front-end highlights include silky ballads &quot;I Thought This Was Ours&quot; and &quot;What Good Is Love?&quot;, while &quot;I'm Not a Robber&quot;, with its skittering drums and keyboard sheen, is the closest thing here to a Hot Chip song.</p>\n<p>This 15-track album starts to taper off around &quot;Musical Food&quot;, one of a couple of pointless drone pieces that pad <em>Rubbed Out</em>'s confused final third. I'm all for drone pieces in general, but Taylor's knack is for razor-sharp pop, not murky ambiance, and his talents feel especially wasted here. We also get brief sketches that might've been cool had they been finished (although one, &quot;I'm Juan&quot;, features some unusually ugly synth sounds), and a closing work-out for booming drums. These pieces feel tacked-on, which their sequencing as the last six tracks supports.</p>\n<p>The parallels between Taylor's <em>Rubbed Out</em> and Yorke's <em>The Eraser</em> go beyond big-band auteurs making intimate solo albums. Consider their titular references to deletion-- of bandmates, of ornate arrangements, of instrumentation, and most importantly, of pressure. Taylor and Yorke seem to have had the same idea-- as their bands threatened to become moribund, they needed to get back to basics. For Radiohead, this re-centering was the pivot between <em>Hail to the Thief</em> and the revivified <em>In Rainbows</em>; hopefully the parallels will continue and <em>Rubbed Out</em> will have the same effect on Taylor's next album with Hot Chip.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In the late 1990s, the anticon. collective emerged as a unique label dedicated to bursting the boundaries of what could be reasonably considered hip hop: Battle freestyles reconstructed as abstruse beat poetry, hip hop production smeared into ambient drone, rap cadences and phrasings bent to indie folk ends. They were leaders with, at first, few followers. But as anticon.'s own recombinant styles began to calcify-- as Why? became more of a straightforward indie rock band, say, or Themselves increasingly spiraled up their own archly-inflected, hyper-syllabic ass-- the label began to seem less like leaders and more like merely idiosyncratic outliers.</p>\n<p>Even as one of anticon.'s founding members, <a href=\"http://www.anticon.com/index.php?section=artist&amp;target=Alias&amp;js=yes\">Alias</a> has always maintained a decidedly low profile on the adventurous label: just a guy and his drum machines holed up in the home studio in Maine. And that's not only compared to big personality MCs like Doseone or Why?'s Yoni Wolf, but even to other in-house producers, such as the relatively flash, TV Carnage-abetted analog screwball Tobacco. Alias seems to relish a certain hermitic anonymity-- right down to the blank-faced moniker-- and it's an attitude reflected in his beats: moody, introspective tracks whose athletic drumming and melancholy melodies make for heavy head-nodders but that can begin to feel a bit faceless.</p>\n<p>Latest album <em>Fever Dream</em> aims to disrupt Alias' comfortable patterns as a producer-- the one sheet talks of being &quot;reborn&quot;-- but it doesn't succeed in making the artist any more familiar, and the change of course feels less like a visionary renewal than it does a well-played catch-up. From the first beat drop, <em>Fever Dream</em> is obviously informed by the vaporized, off-kilter instrumentals of Flying Lotus and likeminded contemporaries: beats shuffle and scatter, bass hits low and leaves space in its wake, samples hiss and dissipate like the air is being sucked out of them, synth lines falter and wobble. This is most true of the album\u2019s opening tracks &quot;Goinswimmin&quot; and &quot;Wanna Let it Go&quot;.</p>\n<p>Deeper into the album, amidst the adaptation, Alias teases out some of his typically thick grooves and understated but staying melodies-- culminating with the one-two combination of the in-the-pocket acoustic drum break that lights up the latter half of &quot;Dahorses&quot; and gives way to the dreamy &quot;la-di-da&quot; vocal echoes of &quot;Lady Lambin'&quot;. Elsewhere, and to lesser effect, Alias calls in fellow anticon. collaborators Why? (whose starring turn in &quot;Well Water Black&quot; gave 2008 LP <em>Resurgam</em> an unlikely single) and Subtle's Dax Pierson. The former contributes a stretched, monosyllabic nasal wail to the chunky beat routine of &quot;Boom Boom Boom&quot;, while Pierson plays keys and sings lead on the bloodless R&amp;B drift of &quot;Talk in Technicolor&quot;.</p>\n<p>So, no, <em>Fever Dream</em>'s new direction doesn't quite recapture the genre-dissolving days of anticon.'s youth or remake Alias into a soon-to-be household name. It does, however, stand as another fine, frequently very satisfying effort from a dependable producer and deft beat-maker.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A lot has happened since the release of Alias' last solo album, <em>Muted</em>, in 2003. Perhaps most notably, Oakland-dwelling Brendon Whitney-- who had left Portland, Maine, to hook up with the rest of anticon.'s preliminary influx of artists following 1998's Deep Puddle Dynamics collaboration (alongside Doseone, Sole, and Atmosphere's Slug)-- headed back home after almost a decade out West. Despite a break in recording solo, and moving away from the community that had supported him since the early days, Alias has had little down time musically. In 2005 he released the instrumental LP, <em>Lillian</em>, with his younger brother Ehren, and the subsequent year he teamed up with New York-based singer Tarsier for another full-length, <em>Brookland/Oaklyn</em>, which paid tribute to trip-hop while expanding their combined interest in contemporary electronica. Fittingly for Alias' first solo recording in five years, <em>Resurgam</em> takes its title from his hometown's Latin motto, translating to &quot;I will rise again.&quot;</p>\n<p>Although anticon. originally provided an alternative platform for geographically disparate but like-minded hip-hop artists when it started in the late 1990s, the label, continually flexible and innovative with its boundaries, has since grown to be equally associated with electronica and indie rock. This unification of genres has been a trademark of Alias since the beginning, and on <em>Resurgam</em> he successfully skips and fuses musical elements from across the board. The opening track, &quot;New to a Few&quot;, has its bearings firmly in 80s-era hip-hop and flares with energy and hard-line beats before sliding into vast electronica with the aptly named &quot;I Heart Drum Machines&quot;. Here, Boards of Canada-style soundscapes open up the space before collapsing into an upsurge of intricate rhythms and melodic samples that alternately break the flow then bring it back forward. These beats are often fairly stock in sound, but it's Alias' melodic additions that keep the steady pace of <em>Resurgam</em> engaging and refreshing, throwing some unexpected turns into the mix and proving that, stylistically, anything goes.</p>\n<p>Fellow anticon. founder Yoni Wolf (aka Why?) joins Alias on the standout track &quot;Well Water Black&quot;, where he ties together his distinctive, introspective monologues with a falsetto melody that wouldn't be out of place on a Flaming Lips record, pitching everything against a jolly background of virtual glockenspiel, happy-go-lucky handclaps, and what sounds like the album's only (thoroughly spectacular) live drum patch. And while tracks such as this conjure images of walking down a sunshiny Oakland avenue with jingling pockets and a spring in one's step, Alias' dice have many sides. Fast-forward six minutes and he's back to an airy instrumental that makes room for all the other ideas searching for space: sad-eyed acoustic indie with the One AM Radio on &quot;Weathering&quot;; propulsive urban electronica on &quot;Autumnal Ego&quot;; clear echoes of Four Tet on &quot;Death Watch&quot;; and the kind of euphoric jams one might expect to hear in a European disco club on &quot;M.G. Jack&quot;.</p>\n<p>While <em>Resurgam</em> is a record of many different moods, and unashamedly derivative of Alias' influences, it maintains a distinctive, concrete consistency. This is largely due to Alias' impressive talent for arrangements; the material is deftly woven with a great ear for detail, and there really is something to appeal to almost everyone. It is precisely this autonomous yet inclusive approach to creating music that Alias and his anticon. cohorts have always supported, and what makes <em>Resurgam</em> even larger than the sum of its parts.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Anticon beatsmith Brendon Whitney, aka Alias, has tapped a broad array of artists to fill out his <em>Collected Remixes</em>. Styles include the One AM Radio's indie rock, John Vanderslices's folky soundscapes, Giardini Di Miro's post-rock, Lali Puna's electro-pop, 13 &amp; God's abstract hip-hop, and the IDM of Christ. Given this diverse list of collaborators, you might expect equally diverse results. That the album is in fact so uniform, playing like an Alias solo effort that pales in comparison to last year's collaboration with vocalist Tarsier, highlights his weaknesses as a producer.</p>\n<p>As remixers go, Alias most resembles a juicer-- no matter what you put in, the same homogeneous goop comes out. And &quot;goop&quot; isn't necessarily as negative as it sounds; it simply alludes to the sneaking suspicion that Alias isn't thinking about the possibilities inherent in the songs he's remixing, only processing them into his own nonspecific instrumental hip-hop, which tends to linger just this side of tedium.</p>\n<p>Still, the results can be tasty or not according to what goes into the blender. The swooning vocals of the One AM Radio's &quot;What You Gave Away&quot; nestle prettily amid sputtering drums and snowy chimes. Lali Puna's &quot;Alienation&quot; sounds fine chopped up into clip-clopping percussion and live-wire synths. And Sixtoo's &quot;Karmic Retribution/Funny Sticks&quot; at least provides some contrast with its chaotic squalls of noise. Bum ingredients sour other passable concoctions: Why? appears on the remix of 13 &amp; God's &quot;Into the Trees&quot; and John Vanderslice appears on the remix of his &quot;Exodus Damage&quot; (duh); both singers have reedy, almost bracing voices that aren't well-suited to Alias's supa-smoove night moves.</p>\n<p>The main problem with the album is that the bulk of it is virtually indistinguishable. Alias fashions Lunz's &quot;Clue&quot; into a skittering, mid-tempo synth glide, reworks Lucky Pierre's &quot;Crush&quot; into a skittering, mid-tempo synth glide, and then, just to shake things up, turns Giardini Di Miro's &quot;Given Ground&quot; into a skittering, mid-tempo synth glide. If you're going to be a one-trick pony, it had better be a really good trick. Alias's isn't bad, just severely limited and predictable, seeming always to conjure the same glacial atmosphere with the same sound palette and the same low-key dynamics. Any of these on their own might impress, but collected together, they blur into anonymity, lacking the diversity or the nuance necessary to uphold the weight of the album format.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Listen up, kids; it's time for me to play like Mr. Rogers. The lesson today concerns the issue of paradox, 'cause this record unfolds like a case fresh out of Webster's: Despite its show of technical proficiency, <em>Muted</em>, the latest full-length outing from Anticon producer Alias, suffers for lack of sentiment or expressive accomplishment. The album's desolate, downbeat production provides the album with a sense of internal subversion, and also represents a pinnacle of craftsmanship, but the tracks are sterile and underdeveloped, suffocating and slumbering through a heavy-handed hour of dirty industrial drum rhythms and distorted glitchwork.</p>\n<p>Breaking almost completely from Alias' hip-hop backlog, <em>Muted</em> is largely instrumental, with the exception of one rhyme-laden track near the record's end, and the unfortunate &quot;Unseen Sights&quot;, where The Notwist's Markus Acher lends his tender vocals in a potentially perfect fit-- one which at least had the barebones makings to parallel his own work in tone and vibrancy. Unfortunately, Acher's insouciant mastery of crestfallen sobriety is dredged from a metallic sea of mercurial and wandering breakbeats. Even his own lyrics, which clumsily allude to American media hiding the bigger picture and abstracting the truth, fail to make a positive impact, and instead freeze him as a caricature of anti-war/anti-consumer backlash. The track's structure and application are too sterile to play on Acher's emotive prowess, and the near-miss collaboration stings, feeling at best like a Notwist demo.</p>\n<p>Much of the album rides a rocky terrain of wandering breakbeats and ambient under/overtones, but a handful of well-realized moments thankfully save the record from infamy. &quot;Full Circle Blues&quot; is a windy, sensual breath on a metal playground full of robots. &quot;Am I Cool Now?&quot;, a moment of self-conscious reflection, features the vocal snippet, &quot;Anticon ain't hip-hop yo/ They try to hard to be weird/ They're only popular on the Internet/ It's just stupid nerd rap,&quot; amidst a slaughtering barrage of drums and heavy beats. &quot;Chew the Fat&quot;, the record's standout, then slides in with an echoing, searching, teeter-totter affair of lively electronic manipulations and release/relapse drumwork. Additionally, the closer (with the exception of the 15-minute break to hide the hidden track) carries the torch of capability with a nice use of space and a more focused compositional design.</p>\n<p>Of course, I'm not out to deprive anyone of their sole sanctuary, being that I might fall into the category of Internet-nerd-critic-- and, as <em>Muted</em> loudly proclaims, Alias is too well informed and knows the game too well to succumb to pressure-- but if he turned some of the knobs down just a bit, and turned up the heat, maybe I could hear a little better.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Thomas Wincek appears to be the type of musician who can never sit still, who is always looking for a new avenue to relay his impulses through. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5703-collections-of-colonies-of-bees/\">Collections of Colonies of Bees</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/27996-volcano-choir/\">Volcano Choir</a> are among the bands that keep him busy, and here on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29168-all-tiny-creatures/\">All Tiny Creatures</a>' debut full-length he's undertaken the thankless task of finding a group of eight different vocalists to collaborate with the band on certain tracks. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/\">Justin Vernon</a> is the closest Wincek gets to finding a constant in his career-- the pair have teamed up in both the aforementioned bands, and Vernon returns here to add a vocal turn to the standout &quot;An Iris&quot;. To cement his workaholic stature, Wincek released the latter song and &quot;Glass Bubbles&quot; ahead of this record, and both of those tracks are complemented by beautifully packaged mixtapes that feature further unreleased material.</p>\n<p>It's clear that a great amount of care and attention to detail has been spread all over this record; it's there in the diligent curation of those singers and in the themed cover art by <a href=\"http://draplin.com/\">Aaron Draplin</a>. It's also there in the music itself-- Wincek and fellow guitarist Andrew Fitzpatrick have an intuitive knack for delicately stacking up spidery riffs so they work perfectly in tandem, while drummer Ben Derickson and bassist Matthew Skemp demonstrate a mastery of subtly infectious and understated grooves. Some of the touchstones for this music are clear from the outset; the opening &quot;Holography&quot; is driven by the kind of ever-cycling drumbeat Klaus Dinger made his trademark in <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/\">Neu!</a>, and the compressed guitar squall is reminiscent of the tones <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3391-archer-prewitt/\">Archer Prewitt</a> lays over the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/\">Sea and Cake</a>'s best tracks. But the breezy vocal humming and frantic soloing toward the end of the song pitch it in a realm where those influences are infused with an unlikely prog and pop crossover, ultimately positioning it in a space unique to All Tiny Creatures.</p>\n<p>From that point on, this is music that sucks you in, that creates a realm full of niggling little harmonies and treated sounds so densely layered that they reveal more only with repeat plays. Vernon's vocal isn't even the most alluring part of &quot;An Iris&quot;-- the song finds its weight through a lightness of touch in the guitar melodies and a puzzling loop that sounds like the noise a person emits when someone treads on their toe. That song sets the emotional tone for the record, with most of <em>Harbors</em> bearing a bittersweet ambiance that its vocalists tap into. In some cases, such as Ryan Olcott's hoarse tones on the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12137-glass-bubbles/\">Playlisted</a> &quot;Glass Bubbles&quot;, it's those vocals that temper the bouncing guitar lines from shifting the track too far toward ebullience. In others, that crestfallen feeling can be more overtly felt in the instrumentation, such as the chiming guitars on &quot;Breathing Set&quot;, or the muted electronic passages of &quot;Valves or Hatches&quot; and the Eno-esque &quot;Triangle Frog&quot;.</p>\n<p>It's striking how <em>Harbors</em> manages to form a central aesthetic that's identifiable as All Tiny Creatures but can also fold in a wide array of influences. The whimsical backing vocals on &quot;Cargo Maps&quot; are reminiscent of the kind of experimentation Brian Wilson was mapping out for <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/\">the Beach Boys</a> on tracks like &quot;Roll Plymouth Rock&quot;, and the stop-start segment of &quot;Aviation Class&quot; manages to bridge Wincek's fascination with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/labels/136-warp/\">Warp</a>-style electronic artists and his leanings toward more traditional forms of shiny guitar pop. The focus starts to slip a little toward the end, with another diversion into ambient drift on &quot;Reservoirs&quot; and more &quot;ahh-ahh&quot; vocal passages in &quot;Tine Feature&quot;. But the rippling guitar and choir-like singing of the closing &quot;Plankton March&quot; ties the loose ends together and again showcases this group's gift for sifting bundles of sincerity into song via the disparate elements at their disposal. That sense of focus on making emotionally redolent material, and keeping the overall thrust of the project in view despite having many hands on the tiller, are ultimately what makes <em>Harbors</em> solidify into a satisfyingly cohesive whole.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This is the fourth <a href=\"http://alog.net/\">Alog</a> record I've <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/228-alog/\">reviewed here</a> in the last seven years, and with each I have to assume that you're reading about them for the first time. Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide are electro-acoustic experimenters from Norway, and they've yet to step out from the dimly lit corners of the contemporary music avant-garde: They've never &quot;broken through,&quot; and at this point I doubt they ever will. Their music is not inaccessible, but it does play with the idea of what music itself can be, and they tend to avoid emotional manipulation. They present sound that is texturally rich and organized in an interesting way, but they're not telling you to feel happy or sad when you listen to it. All of which is to say that they are way down the list of abstract sound-makers likely to appeal to people who have a limited amount of space in their daily listening for abstract sound.</p>\n<p>This is understandable, but it's also a shame, because Alog make wonderful music that sounds only better with time. <em>Unemployed</em>, their most recent album for Rune Grammofon, is very much a continuation of the arc of their previous records, meaning that it doesn't really sound like any of them. Every Alog record-- and indeed every track-- carves out its own space, and Haugan and Eide seem either incapable of or uninterested in repeating themselves. But while they don't have an overriding sonic signature, they do have some broad qualities that drive their approach to music. Their music is whimsical, frightening, sentimental, and atmospheric, often at the same time. On this album, they use location-based instrumental recordings, found sound, field recordings made on tour, and mix it all with studio work that blends samples and live instruments. These elements and approaches are fused together in such a way that you never really know which sound came from where. The result is music that feels open and free, which, for me, serves as a welcome reminder of how much my typical response to music is informed by idiom.</p>\n<p>In general, there are two ideas that inform Alog's music. One the one hand you have playfulness. In the manner of, say, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/\">the Residents</a>, Alog's music has a strong sense of &quot;Let's try this and see what happens.&quot; Tracks like &quot;Apeland&quot;, which seems to be a recording of a gorgeous organ of some kind, but mic'd in such a way that the action on the keys produces both warm drones and a percussive tapping, feels like the product of setting up some microphones in a room and having fun with sound. &quot;Baklandet&quot; seems like a folk song of some kind, sung by a high voice that could be female, but the acoustic instruments are tweaked and messed with slightly, giving the pretty tune a destabilizing warble. &quot;Et Besok&quot;, a simple exercise in the emotional possibilities of vocal processing, takes a voice and does strange things to it, balling it up in effects and then spreading it back out so it assumes a new shape.</p>\n<p>When Alog aren't being playful, they're exploring the idea of music as ritual. In some cases, this comes out in their ear for layered and immersive drones that strike a balance between the electronic and the organic. Alog are good at making tracks that you can turn up and zone out to, tracks that feel like rooms to explore. And then sometimes they turn up the heat. The 17-minute &quot;Last Day at the Assembly Line&quot;, which serves as the centerpiece of the record, is an exercise is tension and catharsis. It mixes caveman drum pounding, rapidly bowed strings that sound like gears grinding away in a machine, and, eventually, voices that chant and coo but favor sound over language. It's a terrifically powerful track that manages to evoke both stasis and decay, and it's continually either building up or falling apart. It definitely brings to mind krautrock, like a super-stripped-down version of the cultish mantras of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/\">Amon D\u00fc</a><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/\">\u00fc</a>l's <em>Psychedelic Underground</em>, but pulling out a term like &quot;krautrock&quot; doesn't quite make sense. Alog get me thinking about what music is and how it works on an almost molecular level, so familiar &quot;sounds like&quot; references feel beside the point. Their music is enjoyable for how it gets me thinking in addition to how it makes me feel. It returns me to that state of hearing something new and alien for the first time and wanting to know more.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If you count the 2005 rarities comp <em>Catch that Totem!</em>, this is the fifth full-length by Alog, the Norwegian duo of Espen Sommer Eide and Dag-Are Haugan. Its title is apparently derived in part from the fact that many of the tracks were made using instruments neither member knows how to play. Such an approach by these two certainly makes sense. They are sound freaks, fascinated by the emotional potential of timbre, always searching for interesting things happening inside the hyphen that typically joins the words &quot;electro&quot; and &quot;acoustic&quot;, so proper technique seems beside the point. When they are at their best, they make to my ears some of the most thrilling experimental music of this decade.</p>\n<p>Alog albums have tended to feel like hodgepodges, where the best of what was left after a long period of tinkering was put together without much thought, but <em>Amateur</em> seems more cohesive thematically. They're making greater use of acoustic sounds here-- particularly a wide assortment of percussion, and also a good amount of guitar-- and a few more tracks than usual feature the human voice. Silence is also more of a presence, and the prevailing mood is low-key and reserved.</p>\n<p>At one extreme on that score is the aptly titled &quot;Sleeping Instruments&quot;. It's not completely without sound, but you'll need a low noise floor in your apartment to hear the tiny creaks and scrapes happening far away from the microphone. Or maybe that was just my ceiling fan. &quot;Exit Virtuoso&quot;, &quot;A Throne for the Common Man&quot;, and &quot;The Learning Curve&quot; all use gamelan percussion, and the latter two make use of various guitars as textural devices. &quot;The Future of Norwegian Wood&quot; captures what seems to be the groans of a tree branch being stressed by a couple on a rope swing mixed with electronic beeps and the rustling of unnamable bric-a-brac, until voices enter spitting out syllables halfway between a whisper and a chant.</p>\n<p>These are all tracks of interest, with lots of space around the sounds and plenty of time to soak everything in. But there's not much going on in terms of composition, no sense that each element is in its place for a compelling reason. In one sense there is something liberating about this quasi-random approach, in that the tracks seem malleable and open, basically tossing back to the listener whatever he or she puts in. Heard from another angle, these pieces can sound like raw material from a Matmos recording session, the scraps waiting to be hammered into shape by a record's overriding concept.</p>\n<p>So the tracks that hold up best to repeated listens are the ones heavier on electronics, the rude bits that don't quite seem to fit with what's going on around them. &quot;Bedlam Emblem&quot; is cranky and abrasive, lots of upper-mid electronic squeals surrounded by halos of static, and it clomps around in an unpredictable way but it also <em>builds</em>, gaining momentum as it presses forward. And &quot;The Beginner&quot;, despite its marked similarity to &quot;St. Paul Sessions II&quot; from the band's 2005 album <em>Miniatures</em>, manages to wring serious tension out of its unblinking repetition. <em>Amateur</em> is certainly a decent record, but those moments offering a glimpse at the breathtaking possibilities of pure sound, which made the last two Alog records so special, are sorely missed.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>You'd expect two guys as in love with sound as Norway's Espen Sommer Eide and Dag-Are Haugan to have a lot of tapes lying around. For this late 2005 release, the two men of Alog were asked by the Oslo-based Melektronikk to assemble the best of their odds and ends. The result is this 13-track collection, which, though not exactly new, have been heard by almost nobody. Included are a couple of previously released remixes and scattered bits from small-run EPs and singles, but they're probably new to you unless you're reading this from Troms\u00f8.</p>\n<p>That a skim of the archive can produce such an interesting record says a lot about the value of the Alog project. It's all over the place, and it shouldn't hang together, and yet it does. Alog called their terrific 2005 album <em>Miniatures</em>, but the title would have been more apt for this release. Ten of these selections are under five minutes; such restraint is a rarity in the world of abstract electronics, but it works wonders when dealing with this level of variety. Each track is a small world unto its own, with a unique palette and structure. Alog get in, lay out the rules, make their statement, and get out, wasting not a note and leaving you wanting more.</p>\n<p>The highlights rank with their best work, and, in one case, with anything I've heard in a long while. The treasure for me is &quot;Song Sung Inwardly&quot;, a highly abstracted reconstruction of material sampled from Italian electro-pop group Slow Motion. It's gloriously accessible pop/noise, oddly song-like, with alternating beams of fuzzy drone that suggest a chord progression. It takes a shoegazey turn when high, harmonizing voices (or brilliant mechanical facsimile thereof) waft in, like a couple of Wilson brothers trapped in the guts of the machine and trying to sing their way out. At only 3:30, I've no choice but to repeat it endlessly.</p>\n<p>But blissed-out drone is only part of the story here. If there's a consistent thread, it's Alog's playfulness, their light touch and wry humor that can occasionally veer toward the twee. &quot;Just Recording&quot; begins with sleigh bells and prayer bowls, but the cloud of incense is pushed out with a weird chorus of clipped, percussive vocalizations from a mixture of kids and adults (it was apparently recorded at a children's school using the facilities instruments on hand). &quot;Something Like Islands of Memory&quot; sounds like something from a Tomlab release, with its dreamy backward guitar mixed with a woman's laughter garbled in a faulty tape machine. &quot;Hej, Vart Blev Det Av Dat'en, Kim?&quot; (&quot;Hi, where did the DAT-tape go, Kim?&quot;) lays the answering machine voice of Norwegian producer Kim Hiroth\u00f8y atop a recording of his entire CD being played on fast-forward, so that the 50-minute album is heard in four. Screwing around, you say? Maybe, but always with a sense of purpose, and with ears wide open.</p>\n<p>Obviously, given its castaways and cutouts nature, <em>Catch That Totem!</em> isn't all brilliant, but even the lesser tracks hold my interest. I'd finish by saying that the inspiring sonic imagination of Alog deserves a much bigger audience, but a couple weeks ago they picked up a Spellemann Award <em>Miniatures</em>. Their website explains that a Spellemann is a &quot;Norwegian Grammy.&quot; Now that's my kind of country.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

Norwegians Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide, who record together as Alog, create abstract but accessible instrumental music that neatly stitches sounds birthed inside a computer with live instruments and field recordings. Alog doesn't sound like a <em>band</em>, exactly, but it also feels some ways removed from the bedroom laptop. They seem to be thriving on the spaces that exist between.</p>\n<p>On 2001's <em>Duck Rabbit</em>, Alog folded in more beats and experimented with the repetition of techno, but on <em>Miniatures</em>-- their third record on Rune Grammofon-- the duo back once again explores the emotional implications of pure sound. We hear guitars, cut-up synths, indeterminate drones, drum machines, and voices probably captured in a marketplace in their native Troms\u00f8 (home of Biosphere, R\u00f6yksopp, etc.), but the tracks resist dissection, existing instead as complex interdependent fabric. Opener &quot;Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss&quot;, which also led off <em>Runeology 2</em>, one of Rune Grammofon's label compilations, now stands in my mind as a stone drone classic. The structure of the track is highly dramatic; it slowly morphs from tinny guitar distortion into the towering wall of sound of Fennesz' dreams before finishing in a lengthy swirl of dissonant strings. Highly original and utterly transfixing from the first listen, &quot;Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss&quot; is a bold statement of intent that the rest of <em>Miniatures</em> lives up to.</p>\n<p>Quieter tracks such as &quot;Steady Jogging of the Heart&quot; draw power from small details, judiciously applying the techniques of laptop glitch to a carefully assembled library of sounds. The timbre of the organ chords of &quot;Steady Jogging of the Heart&quot; conveys easy warmth, while the unsteady pulse imparted by choppy editing suggest an undercurrent of anxiety. &quot;Leyden Jar&quot; digs inside the dirty cracks of music production to find the buried noises, smearing beeps, clicks and percussive scrapes between the speakers in an unpredictable pattern. When more conventional instrumentation is pushed to the fore, we get tracks like &quot;St. Paul Sessions II&quot;, which combines the machine-steady pulse of a single acoustic guitar chord with clouds of vibraphone. Here Alog take the best ideas of Tortoise-style post-rock, strip away the layer of cerebral remove and the focus on instrumental virtuosity, and let the music drift in more emotional (even sentimental) direction. Which seems precisely what's needed.</p>\n<p>It's exciting to know that the same duo created both &quot;St. Paul Sessions II&quot; and &quot;The Youth of Mysterious Conversations&quot;, which sounds like a highly abstracted cover of Derrick May's &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;. Each Alog track is its own small world with its own internal logic, and <em>Miniatures</em> collects nine good ones without a single dud. An excellent record.</p>\n",

As a makeshift cure, I've developed an attention span that rivals a hyperactive prepubescent Christian Scientist. It's not ideal, but at least I'm occupied most of the time. Of course, the key word there is &quot;most.&quot; Snags are hit every time I'm forced to stand in hellish lines, endure overlong anecdotes from friends and strangers alike, and withstand multiple listens of records I would otherwise turn off before the first track was finished.</p>\n<p>Alpha's sophomore album, <em>The Impossible Thrill</em>, is emblematic of the latter example. If having to write about Bristolian trip-hop is taxing, having to listen to it enough to get to that step is brutal-- especially when the material in question makes unintentional strides toward epitomizing dullness.</p>\n<p>By bombarding the listener with innocuousness, Alpha forge a test to determine exactly when the pedestrian becomes excruciating. By the third track, they more or less have their answer. <em>The Impossible Thrill</em> is so pig-headed in its goal to evoke mood that conventions like variation, song structure and memorable songwriting are completely forgone.</p>\n<p>The album's redundancy is particularly inappropriate because of its premise. Instead of continuing on a beat-heavy, electronic path to atmosphere, Alpha employ mostly live instrumentation to augment the rich, bluesy arrangements. Layers of strings glaze the songs, and are heavily depended upon to set the dour, spacy tone. <em>The Impossible Thrill</em> sifts through the constituents of pop trip-hop, exploits its darkness, and ultimately lacks any semblance of groove. A song stringed as manipulatively as &quot;Dim&quot; plays like a reject Blaxploitation theme. And, when the occasional dank beat from a drum machine does pop up, like on &quot;South,&quot; it only retreads the same sterile fare we've heard a million times before from artists like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba.</p>\n<p>The vocalists on the record, Helen White, Wendy Stubbs, and Martin Barnard, only contribute to the drabness. The interchangeable White and Stubbs both exhibit the conviction of mumbling somnambulists. Though aiming to recall a more drugged-out Beth Gibbons, the two never muster anything greater than &quot;wispy.&quot; Barnard's approach is more affected, but just as unmoving. With the vocals low in the mix, it's hard to hear exactly what he's (seemingly) complaining about. And, when the rest of the content is taken into account, it's even harder to care.</p>\n<p><em>The Impossible Thrill</em> is utterly pedestrian and overwrought. Though the songs are mostly composed gracefully, with each part impeccably interlocking, this ultimately can't erase the record's inherent mundaneness. But at least the album lives up to its name; with the knowledge that the thrill is indeed unattainable, it's clear that adventure is best sought in virtually any other outlet.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The style known as electro has no single origin, but its lineage can be traced back to a few fairly clear antecedents. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/581-afrika-bambaataa/\">Afrika Bambaataa</a> and Soulsonic Force\u2019s 1982 single \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d canonized the syncopated rhythmic cadence, played on the Roland TR-808 drum machine, that is central to the style; that song was partly inspired by the lurching, snapping beat of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/\">Kraftwerk</a>\u2019s \u201cNumbers,\u201d from 1981. The Germans had probably been listening to Yellow Magic Orchestra\u2019s Ryuichi Sakamoto, who deployed the same whip-crack syncopations on 1980\u2019s \u201cRiot in Lagos.\u201d But beating them all to the punch was a Miami group called Herman Kelly &amp; Life, who laid down that signature beat in 1978, in a rousing Latin funk song called \u201cDance to the Drummer\u2019s Beat\u201d that would go on to be a major influence on Miami bass, a regional variant of electro.</p>\n<p>Electro\u2019s Latin roots have often been overlooked, but they\u2019re at the center of <em>Afro-Cuban Electronics</em>, the debut album from Miami\u2019s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/33847-alpha-606/\">Alpha 606</a>, which fuses the booming and hissing 808s of classic electro with congas, clave, guiro, and other Afro-Cuban percussion instruments. The project dates back to the early 2000s. Originally, it was a group comprising producers Armando Martinez and Rey Rubio and percussionists Marino Hernandez and Danny\u00a0Chirino, all of Cuban descent (Hernandez, in fact, arrived on Floridian shores in 1980\u2019s Mariel boatlift). They put out their debut EP in 2005, with a remix from fellow Miami electro experimentalists Phoenecia. By 2008, when Detroit\u2019s Interdimensional Transmissions label released the <em>Electr\u00f3nica Afro-Cubano</em> EP, only Martinez remained, and he continues solo on <em>Afro-Cuban Electronics</em>.</p>\n<p>The sound of the music will be familiar to anyone who has heard Hashim\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i46sF1PcqL8%E2%80%9D%20target=\">Al Naafiysh (The Soul)</a>,\u201d Newcleus\u2019 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmg5GaAHbk%E2%80%9D%20target=\">Jam on It</a>,\u201d or any other classic in the electro pantheon; one of electro\u2019s salient features it that it simply doesn\u2019t change very much. It all comes down to syncopated 808 patterns, skeletal synth bass, and not much more, and Martinez remains faithful to the blueprint. Even without the Afro-Cuban addition, electro enthusiasts would find plenty to love here: His rhythms move with the easy grace of a jungle cat flicking its tail; his drums are as crisp as you could ask for, and his synthesizers shimmer with a vivid, sci-fi sheen.</p>\n<p>But the added percussion greatly adds to the music\u2019s dynamism, filling in the empty space with rolling rhythmic counterpoints. On \u201cShake,\u201d the two opposing rhythmic figures\u2014guiro and clave patterns against snapping kicks and claps\u2014bob like double needles on a sewing machine, zipping in and out of each other\u2019s way. The Latin percussion also does wonders for the music\u2019s tone colors, lending a warm, glassy glow to the Roland\u2019s dry thump and scratch. Often, Martinez leaves his percussion elements relatively unadulterated, but occasionally, as on \u201cEndangered Cuban Crocodile,\u201d he leans hard on the effects, running the congas through heavy compression and reverb; the results sound a little like if Warp\u2019s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/\"><em>Artificial Intelligence</em> compilations</a> had an explicit Latin underpinning.</p>\n<p>Martinez does his best to keep things varied; tempos range from a skulking, 110-BPM four-to-the-floor up to 170-BPM rollers. Still, at 13 tracks and nearly an hour (plus a different bonus cut on both the vinyl and digital editions), the album feels a little long. For the most part, these are drum workouts, not songs, per se, and the palette begins to blur together by the record\u2019s end, even with two vocal tracks to break things up.</p>\n<p>On \u201cEngineered Floatation Device\u201d (sic), the heavily processed vocals speak to the experience of Cuban exiles who fled their island home in small boats and rafts, and the song is dark and alluring, with a silver lining of a synthesizer arpeggio. \u201cDefection\u201d covers similar ground, but its chanted couplets and militant theme\u2014\u201cDefection was our only choice/It happened when you first oppressed our voice/We did not retreat from the attack/ We\u2019ve been deep in the swamp working our way back\u201d\u2014feel a little like empty bravado. And the fact that Cuba\u2019s exiled \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d left a trail of blood behind them might leave a bad taste in the listener\u2019s mouth: Alpha 606 is named in tribute to Alpha 66, an anti-Castro paramilitary group, founded by Cuban exiles, that allegedly carried out terrorist attacks on tourist targets in Cuba. The style of the track is clearly meant to recall <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/\">Drexciya</a>, the Detroit electro act who created an Afrofuturist mythology around a supposed race of subaquatic beings who were born to pregnant women thrown overboard during the Middle Passage. But Drexciya\u2019s underwater resistance was an imaginary conceit, and a utopian one at that. Alpha 606 is best when it lets the drums do the talking, and the only thing that goes <em>boom</em> is the kick on the 808.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In my day job, I once got into a discussion with a major company about their brand image. &quot;We want,&quot; said their representative, &quot;to own happiness.&quot; He was so affable that I didn't realize right away how sinister it sounded. Watch the video for &quot;Fascination&quot;, Alphabeat's breakout European hit, and you might think they're playing the same game. It's a dayglo grin-a-thon so unreservedly perky that you scrabble desperately for some kind of side to it, some hidden agenda. Nobody, surely, can have this much pep?</p>\n<p>The Danish pop outfit have recently relocated to London, a wildly successful move. With bands like Scouting for Girls and the Hoosiers, Britain has rediscovered a taste for naggingly upbeat pop. Those bands tend to find a barely adequate hook and whip it till it coughs blood: Alphabeat in comparison are masters of sophistication and craft. &quot;Fascination&quot;'s pre-chorus would be the centrepiece of most songs; its real chorus is a juggernaut; and the song hits a supremely giddy peak with its back-and-forth middle eight. &quot;The word is on your lips-- say the word!&quot; Everybody does. There's something a little rote about its celebratory woah-ho-hos, but &quot;Fascination&quot; is still one hell of a calling card.</p>\n<p>It's also the only track to survive unaltered from Alphabeat's first draft of this debut, a self-titled album that came out in Denmark a year and a half ago. Three of its songs have vanished entirely from <em>This Is Alphabeat</em>, and the band have re-recorded and re-arranged others. The effect has been to transform a well-turned power-pop record-- which attracted approving blogosphere comparisons to the New Pornographers-- into a strange kind of mid-80s wax museum.</p>\n<p>&quot;Boyfriend&quot; offers the clearest example. On the Danish album, it's keyboard-driven new wave pop-- the lead vocal has some of Cyndi Lauper's spiky relish, the backing chants nod to Big Country. On <em>This Is Alphabeat</em>, it's mid-80s eurodance, canned bell and brass presets bubbling in the background and Stine Bramsen is doing a Sam Fox impression, softer and more come-hither. Finally, the new single remix is late-80s hi-NRG, like a lost collaboration between Kylie Minogue and the Pet Shop Boys. This perfectly observed mix happens to be my favorite Alphabeat thing by miles, but it can't quite dispel the impression that there's something a little hollow about a song which changes its period costume so quickly and liberally.</p>\n<p>Other refixes are less successful. &quot;Rubber Boots&quot;, brooding and endearingly odd on the original, is shinier but draggier here. &quot;What Is Happening?&quot; ruins its desperate break-up bounce with a pancake of unnecessary strings-- but by now I'm so wary of Alphabeat's retro expertise that I wonder if this sabotage isn't somehow deliberate, a pastiche of New Pop's meltdown into overproduction.</p>\n<p>It's not all bad news: Throwing dance-pop into the mix may have diffused Alphabeat's focus, but they do it very well-- new tracks &quot;Go Go&quot; and &quot;Touch Me Touching You&quot; are highlights, the latter's sequencer overdrive and falsetto a delightfully demented moment on a rather well-choreographed record. Their fine work is slightly wasted by a bubblegum take on PIL's &quot;Public Image&quot;-- a jolly wheeze in principle, let down by John Lydon's baffling decision not to give his venomous comeback blast a jaunty melody.</p>\n<p>So why did Alphabeat tinker with a solid record to make this curate's egg? The last Danish group to make it big worldwide were Aqua, and certainly the Alphabeat video experience can feel like a vanilla version of &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;'s kindergarten craziness. They would have been tagged as retro anyhow, and this version of their debut presses more nostalgic buttons than its tighter Danish sibling did. On the evidence of the &quot;Boyfriend&quot; remix and the new tracks, if their time machine got stuck in 1987 they could make a more diverting album. But <em>This Is Alphabeat</em> feels labored, sacrificing identity in its endless eagerness to please.</p>\n",

Usually, the explanations I come up with include higher printing costs and a desire for artistic esotericism. In the case of Alpinestars, I believe the answer to lie in the fact that their lyrics are simply not great-- to the extent that they could, at times, pass for an awkward kind of sci-fi poetry. Witness: &quot;You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram.&quot; Or Placebo's Brian Molko singing, &quot;No time or space in the city&quot; in a forced sneer attempt to drive home the fact that this band is making MUSIC that THINKS about the FUTURE!!!!</p>\n<p>Alpinestars play modern, trance-y synth-pop with zero edge and melodies with zero hook, which everyone knows are the two key elements synth-pop bands revolve around in the first place. The couple tracks that are sort of decent-- like &quot;Snow Patrol (Part 1)&quot;, which combines screaming synths with a techno beat, or &quot;NuSEX City&quot;, whose dorky, <em>NOVA</em>-oh-shit!-check-this-trippy-keyb-line self-wonderment is countered by a fairly tite disco jam-- are sullied with the kinds of vocal effects placed over the nasal yawl of Britney Spears and all her teen pop progenies. Even the &quot;Bobby Peru's Electrostar Edit&quot; remix of &quot;Carbon Kid&quot;, which adeptly plunges itself into snappy, almost experimental, hot electro tweaks, is sullied by the Hi-NRG style splicing of Molko's cheesy vocals over the only good synth melody on the record. Plus effects.</p>\n<p>But okay, by &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, which is track 7 out of 12 and shamefully rips its melody of unquestioning happiness from &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, you'll be longing for the tracks that sound swiped from U2's <em>Zooropa</em>. Elsewhere, inspiration seems desperately plucked from such dicey sources as The Soup Dragons and <em>Give Out But Don't Give Up</em>-era Primal Scream (as on &quot;Hotel Parallel&quot;), or are stolen outright from, say, New Order's &quot;Temptation&quot; (as on &quot;Burning Up&quot;). Now, normally I wouldn't be so careless about wanton name-dropping and comparison-making, but merely imagining the music that inspired Alpinestars is far more interesting than Alpinestars' actual record.</p>\n<p>I don't know who listens to this antiseptic electro-pop, or how they can distinguish it from any of the other insipid dance-schlock that DJ Neiman Marcus spins while they compare Kate Spade bags at the upscale boutiques on Madison Avenue, but I know this: IT'S FUCKING HELL. If I want to listen to the Pet Shop Boys I'll put on Magnetic Fields.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Headphones. You must have headphones. Berlin-based producer Carsten Nicolai, who releases music as Alva.Noto, has assembled an album of tones so pure it would be a shame to sully them with the reflective surfaces of your listening area. There should be as little space as possible between your eardrums and the pulsing diaphragm of the speaker trying (possibly in vain) to translate <em>Transform</em>'s pristine sound waves into vibrating pockets of air. If the technology were available, one might consider wiring the bitstream of a CD player directly into the auditory cortex, thereby eliminating the inevitable distortions introduced by irregular vibrations of the eardrum. Alas, such a brilliant invention is unlikely in my lifetime, so let's stick with the headphones.</p>\n<p>Like Ryoji Ikeda, whose <em>+/-</em> album is a major influence here, Carsten Nicolai is concerned with the fundamentals of electronic sound production. Sine waves, white noise, clicks, pops and beeps-- that's about all there is to the ten untitled tracks of <em>Transform</em>. Synthesizers could make all these sounds when Brian Eno was a wee lad eyeing the acoustic guitar hanging in the shop window. Music this minimal is like good cooking in that the ingredients are simple and the genius is in the arrangement. <em>Transform</em> is like a hot cup of delicious miso soup.</p>\n<p>Nicolai's keen sense of rhythm is the first thing you'll notice about <em>Transform</em>. Track 4 has a particularly propulsive drive, with a thrust of bass static, stop/start buzzing in the upper register, and something approaching a beat coming from the glitches in the midrange. The bass hook that leads into track 6 has something of a pop quality, with a classic ascending/descending motif (just don't hold your breath for a chorus). Nicolai sticks to clear rhythm structures and arranges his glitches in riffs, and memorable patterns abound.</p>\n<p>When he's not forcing his battery of microtones to dance the mashed potato, Nicolai delves into icy atmosphere. The tones here are as dry and cold as a drafty apartment with baseboard heat, and not even a hint of reverb colors the individual sounds. The studied aridity of the recording reinforces the need for headphones; hearing even the slightest echo from the back wall would negate what <em>Transform</em> seems to be going for. Track 2 is nothing more than a sine wave in the 400 Hz range that wavers slowly from ear to ear, topped with a cricket-like chorus of static that cuts out occasionally, leaving behind a single lonely beep. Track 9 is one of the few tracks to leave the grid behind, as hesitant, irregular crackles mimic the sound of a frightened animal, and another crystalline drone adds an ominous cast.</p>\n<p>While <em>Transform</em> is a solid success on its own terms, the record lacks a certain spark that might push it into greatness. There are no moments of wonder, where you pause and listen closer, straining to understand how something so little could affect you so much. It is possible to achieve the sublime with these limited ingredients (see Ikeda, for one), but <em>Transform</em> is merely good.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Ever since Diplo and his larger Hollertronix collective started bringing fairly unvarnished versions of popular urban genres like crunk, Bmore club, and Miami bass to the discerning hipster elite, there's seemingly always been a steady undercurrent of backlash directed at the crew either on the grounds of lazy cultural appropriation or cynically ironic repackaging. To his credit, Diplo's always seemed like a genuine, serious student of his favorite sounds, and the tunes have been almost uniformly hot, so it was easy to accept not only an icon-in-her-own-right like M.I.A. but also a savvy chameleon like Santigold and even, to a degree, expertly crass party-starters like Spank Rock.</p>\n<p>But, I suppose, a line must be drawn in the sand, and thrusting her crotch in the air obliviously on the wrong side of the divide is Amanda Blank. She's no Maya or Santi for sure, but vitriol against the girl has been especially intense considering that up until now she'd been on only a couple of mixtapes and on one track from Spank Rock's debut. Perhaps some of the extra-forceful disdain is owing to the fact that Blank sort of feels like the last bulwark between some imagined indie community of shared self-awareness and an outright void of crassness. Either she's working too hard to construct a mimetic parody of materialistic fuck-pop, or she's not working hard enough to separate herself from it. Either way, I don't see how you're not better off listening to Lady Gaga, who at least offers pretty good hooks.</p>\n<p>A few good hooks, in fact, would go a considerable way toward redeeming Blank's largely forgettable debut, <em>I Love You</em>. Remember, Santigold's eponymous bow certainly didn't blaze any trails either, but it was chock full of irresistible, indelible tunes. Not so with Blank, who submits an album that runs a mere 33 minutes and yet still can't manage to outfit it properly, eschewing even the pursuit of catchiness and pop fun in favor of deathly deterministic robo-chants like &quot;Lemme get some/ You don't want none&quot; and &quot;hottest motherfucker on the whole damn block,&quot; repeated <em>ad nauseum</em>. (Admittedly, &quot;Big Heavy&quot; does have a nice Blondie-ish breeze.) The torpor extends to Diplo, Switch, and Blank's other beatminders, who largely recycle well-worn tricks they've ponied up elsewhere, from the skipping vocal samples and dancehall drum fills of &quot;Something Bigger, Something Better&quot; to the crunk claps of &quot;Lemme Get Some&quot;. Only &quot;DJ&quot;, with its burbling techno groove, really succeeds at wringing something useful from Blank's &quot;persona,&quot; evocatively communicating the self-abnegation of loneliness without sounding too much like a Peaches-level lobotomy victim. Of course, it's sandwiched between two tracks that troublingly rely on a beloved 1980s pop classic for much of their juice, Blank's <em>Top Ranking</em> mixtape holdover &quot;A Love Song&quot; (interpolating LL Cool J's &quot;I Need Love&quot;) and <em>I Love You</em>'s first single, the pointlessly &quot;titillating&quot; &quot;Might Like You Better&quot;, which cannibalizes Romeo Void's &quot;Never Say Never&quot;. Keep in mind, to date these are Blank's two best-known songs.</p>\n<p>Far more apropos is the straight-up cover of Vanity 6's trashy relic, &quot;Make-Up&quot;, a song penned for the 80s pop tarts by their puppetmaster, Prince. I don't know who's responsible for picking this song for the album, but if it's Blank then I at least ought to tip my cap at her stunningly precise grasp of her own place within the Diploverse.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Sometimes it astounds me how many bands are content to callously rip off the sounds of other artists. These bands attempt to meticulously emulate that which they cannot themselves imagine, and always to middling results. Others mimic certain elements of multiple bands and combine them into one incongruous whole. Still others snatch bits of existing songs, employing artist license to add heft to their own work by nabbing someone else's. These techniques are rarely effective in any other respect than making these bands look like total dipshits. But there's one technique that consistently produces interesting results: when a band simply touches the influences that inspire them, acknowledging their force but also challenging them. Music as an artform evolves when talented bands touch and are touched-- when, if you will, they abide by Newton's Third Law of Motion.</p>\n<p>Ambulance Ltd. is a young, talented Brooklyn quintet that violates that law. Their self-titled EP is a collection of five vastly different songs, each an expert forgery of the work of some 90s indie rock muse. But considering the band's malleability and wide-ranging rock sensibility, it's particularly frustrating that these songs are only isolated forgeries and not the riveting atom-splitters that could have resulted.</p>\n<p>&quot;Stay Where You Are&quot; is Ambulance's Elliott Smith song. Like all Smith compositions, it's melodically very pretty-- singer Marcus Congleton even pulls off a confident imitation of Smith's vocals. Guitars are subdued, only coming to prominence every two bars to announce a change in chord, but providing a distinct internal drive. The drumming is masterfully subtle: the bass drum puts four to the floor, accompanied by a steady ride and some occasional tom work. It takes two minutes, however, for a snare to enter the mix at all, finally breaking up the bass drum's steady pound and setting the rest of the instrumentation free. It's slightly gimmicky, sure, but the effect is nicely dramatic, and has much to do with this track being the EP's standout.</p>\n<p>After the ho-hum, honky-tonk regurgitation &quot;Primitive (The Way I Treat You)&quot;, Ambulance launch into &quot;Heavy Lifting,&quot; a song composed of three very distinct parts. First comes the My Bloody Valentine shoegazing portion, followed by an early Beatles interlude, and then, perhaps ironically, a climax unlaudably ripped from the piano solo in Guns N' Roses' &quot;November Rain&quot;. Elsewhere, &quot;Helmsman&quot; learned everything it knows from <em>Washing Machine</em>-era Sonic Youth, while &quot;Young Urban Professional&quot; is a fun lilt that one very well could have found on Yo La Tengo's most recent effort, <em>Summer Sun</em>.</p>\n<p>There have been several other bands mentioned as reference points for Ambulance Ltd.-- more than anyone could reasonably be expected to tolerate-- but it serves to reiterate that Ambulance is truly a very malleable band with tons of energy and much occupation with detail. Here, they've very meticulously (though perhaps unwittingly) isolated their influences. With any luck, they'll grow more adventurous on future releases, <em>recontextualize</em> those influences, and arrive at their own unique sound-- a blueprint for future Ambulance Ltd.'s to emulate in their embryonic stages.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Amir Alexander is 42 years old, and\u00a0<em>Love &amp; Fear</em> is his debut album. A former Army brat who eventually settled in Chicago, Alexander has been DJing since 1993 and making music for nearly as long, but he only began releasing records around 2008. In that light, the cover image of a mountain climber scaling a snowy peak at a 45-degree angle has a slight autobiographical tinge: In electronic music, full-lengths always tend to constitute milestones, but for an artist like Alexander, who has made his name later than many, there's a palpable sense of raised stakes.</p>\n<p>Appropriate for someone with such a deep and abiding investment in a scene, Alexander uses <em>Love &amp; Fear</em> to contend with the legacy of American techno. Any attempt to extend that legacy raises questions: How do you evoke a classic sound when innovation was central to that tradition? Can you pay tribute to your roots without the music withering on the vine?\u00a0Making do with the same sorts of synthesizers and drum machines that have dominated dance music for the past quarter-century, his response is to worry less about novel sound design and focus on his machines'\u2014and his own\u2014expressive capabilities.</p>\n<p>One way he does that is to explore a far wider range of tempos than most. &quot;A Virtuous Woman!&quot; treads a strange, slow-motion path, stepping and strutting, as a scaly bassline ties itself up in writhing knots, and atonal bleeps suggest the ghost of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/\">Kraftwerk</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPiCeLwh5o\">&quot;Numbers&quot;</a>. The title track is even slower, with a stately synthesizer melody that braids itself around snapping, deliberate hi-hats and rimshots. Even sitting in your chair, you can tell that it's a track made for dancers, an invitation to move the body in different ways. &quot;The Blues (Never Had)&quot;, even slower, offers the opportunity to get horizontal: smeared in jazzy chords, pitch-bent keyboard solos, and meandering vocals, it's a narcotic funk number, while &quot;Tranquility Base!&quot; dials up the tempo to footwork's high-flying range. It's woozier than most footwork, though, with tightly syncopated rimshots banging like a screen door in a storm, and hi-hats spinning like a wheel that can't get traction. &quot;That's how I feel inside,&quot; sings a doleful voice, as chilly Juno pads voice even chillier chords, buzzing and bracing as an ice-cream headache. The only tranquility here is an overarching sense of numbness.</p>\n<p>He also experiments with instrumentation\u2014&quot;A Child Is Born&quot; pairs the chimes of '90s electronica with the fat, rich tones of a church organ\u2014and with themes not often represented in techno. In &quot;Nordisk Saga!&quot;, he looks north for inspiration and overlays his moody synths and sparse drums with a dramatic reading of a Nordic saga written by Cecilia Bruun Hansen, all crisp consonants and alien-sounding vowels and rolled &quot;R&quot;s, and references to Freyja and Ragnarok. He presumably got the idea from his time in Malm\u00f6, where he lives for part of the year. But given how often white European producers have appropriated African-Americans' voices\u2014all those tracks made with Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, for instance\u2014Alexander's Scandinavian gambit also amounts to a clever turning of the tables.</p>\n<p>But at the root of Alexander's music is a simple knack for what makes sounds come alive, both on the dance floor and off. The three relatively straight-down-the-middle techno/house cuts here are among the most immediate, attention-grabbing work he's produced yet, although none of them quite nail the spooky transcendence of 2013's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEBBj9PeMw\">&quot;Don't Go&quot;</a>. In &quot;Tight Situations&quot;, carefully deployed dissonance sends chills down the spine, and he shows off his arranger's chops with counterpoints that sneakily keep evolving. &quot;Moist Flesh!&quot; is a warm bath of swelling pads and playful plucked leads. And the crowning glory of it all is &quot;Komm, s\u00fc\u00dfer Tod, komm selge Ruh!&quot;, which takes its title from one of Bach's <em>69 Sacred Songs and Arias</em>. The bassline takes the form of a gnarled, shape-shifting throb; the background swirls with metallic chirps; and as the track patiently unfolds, it gives way to a wild, psychedelic cadenza reminiscent of one of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/\">Prince</a>'s guitar solos. &quot;Come sweet death, come blessed rest,&quot; is the translation of the title, and the song's graceful chord changes echo the sentiment, faintly. But that solo tells another story; there's too much struggle in Alexander to stop here. That peak on the album cover will be scaled, come hell or high water.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>An album's closing track can spoil everything, as Ammoncontact's <em>One in an Infinity of Ways</em> demonstrates. Before the salt is tasted in the sugar, this L.A.-based jazz-hop unit unveils several nourishing, leftfield instrumental grooves. But when Sol Uprising's Lil Sci delivers a laser-cut rap on the record's final track-- one that would perfectly complement the opener, instrumental space-out &quot;Dreamy&quot;-- the absence of MCs becomes glaring and the album suddenly seems like a collection of missed opportunities. Or, as Lil Sci puts it: &quot;That's why I don't judge until I hear the half of the half.&quot; <em>One in an Infinity of Ways</em>, indeed. In all fairness, the incomplete-art element is what Ammoncontact's Carlos Ni\u00f1o and Fabian Ammon are possibly reaching for on their second album, as hip-hop and psychedelic jazz instrumentals are often left 50% done for future remixing and rapping. However, when producers can neither afford a set of guests nor rhyme worth a damn, most of the music simply falls in the background-- for good or ill.</p>\n<p>That said, &quot;Dreamy&quot; falls into the good, and it can leave one seeing purple, red, and orange spots everywhere the eye glances. Bedroom-techno dandy Daedelus supplies the bass clarinet thrumps and acoustic guitar licks that dart about while a flute sample melts the cortex. As previously mentioned, the inclusion of Lil Sci's laidback rhymes about keeping your chin up during adversity may could proven that psychedelica can sell almost any public service announcement. Unfortunately, other choice MC spots also turn up two cherries with each pull of the slots.</p>\n<p>&quot;Healing Vibrations&quot; has a looped Afro-jazz beat that nearly rivals the Apache break before Ni\u00f1o and Ammon seamlessly let the music nod off into a 2 a.m. jazz trance courtesy of bassist/guitarist Greg Malone and skinsman Andres Renteria. It's one of many moments when Ammoncontact successfully blur the line between the sampler and live instruments. The three-part &quot;Infinity of Rhythm Instrumental&quot; knocks listeners awake with a bludgeon by conga before settling into a methanol haze with downtempo Rhodes funk. Other fine tracks include the P-Funk bounce of, ahem, &quot;Fun Is for Funky&quot; and the robotic funk of &quot;Wu Woomp Whoomp&quot;, which struggles to escape the length of its two-foot power cord.</p>\n<p>Prefuse 73's Scott Herren has called Ammoncontact's sound &quot;machine funk,&quot; yet it's one that is devoid of poetry. Bare-boned throwaways &quot;Through the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wu Wu Woomp&quot; (you read right) drag a tepid hip-hop beat around in circles-- dying for the verses of any li'l Johnny who found God in the Gospel according to Emniem. &quot;Like Waves of the Sea&quot; has a swank Latin-jazz bass riff that sadly goes nowhere, while the staccato orchestral tease &quot;Ballad of the Untitled&quot; sounds too incomplete to even count as a lock-groove piece. The demand for an emcee savior is exacerbated with every listen.</p>\n<p>The nagging title <em>One in an Infinity of Ways</em> implies that Ammoncontact are capable of greater good, and they would've left the listener with a remarkable batch of abstract sketches-- if Lil Sci hadn't exposed the nudity of it all. I can't wait for the remixes to hopefully correct things.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This is theoretically a fantastic time for Amon Tobin to return to form. The Montreal producer cut his teeth on drum and bass in the late 1990s, proving time and again he was one of the genre's most creative practitioners. Meanwhile, for the past two or three years, labels like Med School, Critical, and NonPlus+ have helped free drum and bass from a creative stasis. Tobin, though, has never really been one for movements, or revivals of movements. His career interests span tasteful breakbeat jazz, aggressive storms of percussion, and moody video game soundtracks. Until 2007's <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9945-the-foley-room/\">Foley Room</a></em>, every direction had been underpinned by the orchestral and jazz samples Tobin favored working with.</p>\n<p><em>ISAM</em>, the densest, most fractal album of Tobin's career, again abandons sampling in favor of digitally altered samples of Tobin's own. It is a collaboration with London-based visual artist <a href=\"http://www.tessafarmer.com/\">Tessa Farmer</a>, whose work is heavy on scary looking bug-warrior skeletons. Tobin sings for the first time, though his vocals are &quot;gender modified,&quot; sometimes sounding like a woman, but more often like a cipher for his machines. This level of obfuscation contrasts the familiar, jazzy samples that marked his work for so long. Even when Tobin's tracks were hustling along at 180 bpm, his considered sampling afforded them a structural grace.</p>\n<p>In abandoning his long-held methods for concepts-- both musical and extra-musical-- Tobin's work has come untethered. <em>ISAM</em> cuts closer to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/\">Autechre</a>'s entropic electro than anything in Tobin's catalog. At times, during the opening moments of &quot;Mass &amp; Spring&quot; and &quot;Night Swim&quot; for instance, Tobin approaches psych-y drone music. &quot;Goto 10&quot; is a mechanistic lullaby, while &quot;Journeyman&quot; indulges in a slow-leak bass fantasy. These are deconstructions all. Nowhere on <em>ISAM</em> does the beat congeal around a head-nodding tempo, nor can Tobin's melodies stroll for long before finding a cliff's edge. It's hard to imagine <em>ISAM</em> accompanying another artist's work: It is by no means gallery-pleasing mood music, and its constant stops and starts are immensely distracting.</p>\n<p>Tobin used to be a dependable, dedicated craftsman, but he's intent on transitioning to full-on sonic artist. He has the ideas: <em>ISAM</em>'s pieces keep wandering into unmarked industrial zones, evoking broken things and blight. But this is heavy, foreboding music; Tobin hasn't yet learned how to balance his robust sound-art impulses with footholds for his listeners. He'll get there-- he's frankly too talented not to-- but <em>ISAM</em> feels like a transitional album, for his fans if not for him.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>For someone with such an uncanny aptitude for evoking a wide range of cinema-friendly mood music, Amon Tobin's potential as a soundtracker seems to have been largely unrealized. What he does have on his resum\u00e9-- the scores to stealth-kill video game <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>, a surrealist, morbid Hungarian film about taxidermy, and a car commercial in which a group of presumably nude silhouettes contort their way into the shape of an SUV-- hints at why. Since Tobin makes no distinctions between background and foreground music and tends to wring as much distortion, dissonance, and rhythmic unease as he can from his jazz and orchestral-skewing sample sources, his music tends to evoke a malevolent presence that, whether skulking or charging, easily overwhelms all but the most immersive and eye-catching visual accompaniment.</p>\n<p>The irony in Tobin's <em>The Foley Room</em> is that his cinematic ear has spurred him toward different motion picture-derived source material. Paring down his repertoire of bop debris and Ennio Morricone/Jerry Goldsmith evocations, Tobin's assembled his newest album as if he's decided he's exhausted the possibilities of musical instruments themselves and gone outside with a microphone to find out what sort of ambient sounds would make good beats. It makes sense in that the only thing that separates the manipulated sound of a household appliance or the drone of machinery from an electronically generated percussive effect is the element of familiarity; given the way Tobin's samples tend to transmutate traditional orchestration into concussed unrecognizability, manipulating a non-musical effect into a similar state is an inevitable step, one that he initially took in 1998 with <em>Permutation</em> and has been creeping towards ever since.</p>\n<p>But while other musique concr\u00e8te specialists such as Matmos aim to bring specific messages to mind with their thematic choices of sound manipulation, Tobin's approach seems to aim strictly for the aesthetic-- like two slabs of raw steak smacked together to simulate a punch to the head in some 1930s radio serial, the meaning of the medium's less important than how the end result sounds. Some of the effects' usage is a bit self-aware of their non-musical origins: &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot; is just that, a booming series of splashes that sound like elastic liquid dripping into a stainless steel basin and ricocheting its way down the drain; the fuzztone in the metallic drill-n-bass of &quot;Esther's&quot; is boosted by the rumble of a motorcycle engine, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; style (a rumble augmented by, and this required looking up, the sound of restless wasps); the title track introduces a few clamorous mess-making tumbles and crashes, shaped into something that sounds like the collapse of a kitchen shelf set to an Art Blakey drum solo.</p>\n<p>But not everything is as blatantly laid out: The Robitussin whir that &quot;The Killer's Vanilla&quot; breathes through could be anything from a slowed-down pipe organ to a creaking set of gears passed through a filter or three, not to mention the way &quot;Keep Your Distance&quot; blurs the lines between woodblock-and-cowbell percussion and what seems to be the clamor of a recycling bin tipping over. Since Tobin still uses his share of musical instrumentation (including a memorable Slavic-esque string melody contributed by the Kronos Quartet on &quot;Bloodstone&quot;), figuring where the musician ends and nature or the machinery or the junkpile begins is intriguingly confusing. Supposedly there are recordings of ants eating grass and building acoustics somewhere on this record, but damned if they're easy to pinpoint amidst the beats.</p>\n<p>Once the novelty of the record's field recording collage-job settles down, <em>The Foley Room</em> proves to be rhythmically consistent with Tobin's glitchy, post-jungle M.O., if somewhat exploratory; a couple moments flirt with dubstep but get too twitchy and restless to segue all that comfortably into your typical Burial track, and the broken-down carnival dance-rock of &quot;Always&quot; is just close enough to a genuine crowd-pleasing dancefloor number that it's a bit startling when the inevitable diamond-crushing load of distorted bass comes in. In the end, what makes <em>The Foley Room</em> Tobin's best album in seven years is the way his bent for organized chaos manifests as a deft control of every sound that surrounds him: Anything's a beat, everything's a break, and the difference between sound and music is entirely contextual.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>I play video games, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed.</p>\n<p>All: <em>How ashamed are you?</em> Me: If I were I carrying a ladder, I'd look like a fire engine. If I placed a leaf on my head, a child might polish me and place me on his teacher's desk. A salivating man with a boiling pot of water, a pair of tongs, a stick of butter, and a plastic bib is circling me menacingly <em>right now</em>. If you get my drift.</p>\n<p>Video games still aren't quite cool, but the arrival of Amon Tobin's noirish, cinematic soundtrack for the third installment in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video game series, <em>Chaos Theory</em>, proves that they're at least getting cooler. It also illuminates how far video games have come since my mom picked me up from school brandishing <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and just blew my mind (&quot;Sweet heaven, it's <em>gold</em>. Not gray-- gold!&quot;).</p>\n<p>As video games become more like interactive films, the ante is upped for their soundtracks as well. The canned, wobbly synth melodies that once cheerily bounced our 8-bit, pixilated heroes through their 2-D side-scrollers no longer suffice, and while this is the first video game soundtrack by a respected underground musician that I can recall, I seriously doubt it will be the last.</p>\n<p>Scoring a video game presents a different set of problems than scoring a film. The latter's structure is fixed, but the former's is variable. <em>Splinter Cell</em> is an espionage game with numerous environments, some revolving around tension and stealth, others around hectic chases and high-octane shootouts. The music needs to follow suit, and flow seamlessly from one mood to the next.</p>\n<p>Tobin handles this problem by making all the songs sound...well, rather similar. He takes full advantage of this opportunity to be as over the top as he wants to be, and his soundtrack is busy, dark, percussive, and abrasive. There are &quot;running&quot; songs (&quot;CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA&quot;) and &quot;sneaking&quot; songs (&quot;chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga&quot;). There are lots of sonar blips, modem crackles, alarms, and detonations. There are howling digital winds and fluttery textural embellishments (imagine the horror movie staple: &quot;Ooh Ooh ooh ooh...Ah Ah ah ah...&quot;). While the tracks complexly evolve in Tobin's usual fashion, they generally begin with cacophonous, atmospheric noise to which lean, fleet polyrhythms are subsequently applied.</p>\n<p>The <em>Chaos Theory</em> soundtrack is James Bond panache meets dystopian nightmare. Sure, it's no <em>Supermodified</em>, but <em>Supermodified</em> wasn't created to be endlessly looped behind onscreen spy ops. This isn't a revolutionary album for Tobin but it's a lot of fun, and works surprisingly well on its own, given the stringent requirements it had to meet.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>As a man who's often credited with reigniting the sputtering spark of drum 'n' bass, Amon Tobin has a huge burden to carry. To date, his studio releases have lived up to standard he set by his earliest recordings under the Ninja Tune banner, plastering the testosterone-fueled aggression inherent in hard jazz over volcanic basslines and finely chopped beats. Tobin mines subtlety from minor changes in volume and pacing, but relies almost exclusively on sheer force to bowl over the listener. His music is ominous and looming, mysterious and cinematic, despite its menace. Even as 2002's <em>Out from Out Where</em> nodded to the Chemical Brothers' big beat/psychedelia pastiche, Luke Vibert's kitchen sink breaks, and the organic jazz textures of Roni Size, his DJ sets have always been about shock and awe above shade and nuance.</p>\n<p>Recorded live in Melbourne, Australia for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel radio series, Tobin's sound here is derived purely from a laptop, two pieces of vinyl, and Final Scratch, a software package that allows him to mix digital audio files via a turntable interface. For almost a full hour, Tobin flows through several moods in all his ear-splitting, creeped-out, bass-heavy hysteria. Those moods mainly range from dark to darker, but eventually come out the other end of the tunnel with a relatively gentle comedown.</p>\n<p>In lieu of hiring a full band to recreate his songs, Tobin's tourdates primarily consist of DJ sets like this one, and as such, he tends to throw many of his own tracks into the blender. Song of his like &quot;Chronic Tronic&quot; and &quot;Verbal&quot;, which almost come off with a nod and a smile on <em>Out from Out Where</em>, are here taken into a back alley and roughed up with jackhammer breaks and chasms of reverb. The roar and moan work well here, tempered by spiraling rhythmic structures, quickly shifting tracks, or clever sampling-- all of which Tobin takes advantage of without remorse.</p>\n<p>A brief LL Cool J quote bleeds into the hip-hop opening of Cherrystones' &quot;Pressure Cooker&quot;, and a snippet of an astronomy lecture evokes a vintage Space Mountain feel at the end Tobin's &quot;Marine Machines&quot;, before diving into the vintage <em>Space Invaders</em> warfare of &quot;Schmalla&quot; by Facs &amp; Smythe. These bright moments stab out of the fog and give the listener something to hold on to while Tobin keeps the bass in full force.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a ponderous midsection mires the maddening pace of the album's first and final thirds. Here, Tobin blends 13 tracks in less than 20 minutes, killing the heightened anxiety by total anesthesia, drumming and bassing us into numbness. Normally known for extended, intricate transitions, the blending of these tracks seems forced-- almost clumsy. The press notes accompanying the album mention that some songs were excised from the set in post-production due to lack of legal clearance for samples, and some of these transitions lead me to believe that something is literally missing from these segues, as they're so uncharacteristically inelegant.</p>\n<p>Things pick back up during the final third of the record, though, as we find Tobin at his most playful and surreal. His &quot;Night Life&quot; is the first downtempo respite of the set, a churning break accompanied by Arabesque flute and brass. Future Prophecies deliver some future-funk breaks with the well-titled &quot;Deep Impact&quot;. This is soon followed by the shuffle and bounce of Dizzee Rascal's &quot;Sittin' Here&quot;, in which the UK garage star's vocals seethe and bubble with effects (though are almost entirely drowned in what must've been a muddy P.A. mix).</p>\n<p>The last 12 minutes-- a including mashup of three Tobin originals-- offer some innovative peak moments, probably leaving the drunken bogan crowd shaken to their Ug Boots. Here are the schizoid arrangements and found-sound samples that makes Tobin's albums so intriguing. The elephantine bass of &quot;Proper Hoodidge&quot; slowly fades into the breaking cymbals and strings of &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot;, which then slides into &quot;Hey Blondie&quot;'s electro synths. And then comes a truly inspired finale: Tobin drops a majestic, cathartic &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, slow-breaks style, that despite the low vocal volume closes the album with a heavy-lidded sigh.</p>\n<p>Of course, even with Lou Reed's hermaphroditic voice lightening the set's loafers, <em>Recorded Live</em> is overwhelmingly masculine. In other words, if you're looking for delicate, atmospheric beats you won't find them here. What the disc does contain is a brutish, undeniable muscle that makes it an enthralling and abrasive listen. Best be sure your speakers can handle the workout.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The nineties were a great time for beat cooking, and the London-based Ninja Tune label had some strong stew, from DJ Food's tasty hors d'oeuvres, to slices from Coldcut and Funky Porcini, to The Herbaliser's homegrown selections. But that decade has passed and-- post-pot smoke and the deleterious effects of &quot;trip-hop&quot; on the reception of downtempo grooves-- it's hard to deny that a good chunk of it sounds really dated. Not so for the man called Amon, whose ability to evoke entire jazz symphonies from two turntables and a sampler caused much jaw-dropping and salivation. He quit school and composed <em>Bricolage</em> and <em>Permutation</em>, each blending jazzy samples and drum-n-bass into tours de force that still sound fresh today.</p>\n<p>Of course, given the rapid pulse of the electronic scene, it's easy to forget that Tobin has steadily churned out an album every two years. In 2000, he dropped his first real departure, the aggressive <em>Supermodified</em>, which digitized his sound into fractals for the 21st century. Having paid his dues and grasped his contribution, he's left the exploration of improv's interstices to DJ Spooky and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series and has since ventured into the furthest realms of space. <em>Out From Out Where</em> beams back at us from one of those planets where mutant morlocks throw block parties and robo-dogs get it on with intelligent fire hydrants. It's a future that may not end in dystopia; there are a few user-friendly moments once you get past all the sharp edges.</p>\n<p>The physics of drums and bass haven't been abandoned altogether, evidenced in the insane opener &quot;Back From Space&quot; as a barrage of tech fills skitter amongst chimes and the surprise accompaniment of heavy metal guitar. But Tobin seems less concerned with showing off tricky breaks and Krupa-on-crack rhythms here, and more taken with just rocking the house. Thus, &quot;Chronic Tronic&quot; oscillates cycles of beats with hissing snare pistons, mining post-electro territory similar to that explored by Skinny Puppy or Download. &quot;Cosmo Retro Intro Outro&quot; likewise pursues a dance vibe, though this time it recalls an old-school rave-up as synth vamps come at the climax to push aside the junglist influence. This isn't easy listening in any sense of the word, but you have to nod your head to the nasty bass tremors on &quot;Rosies&quot; that echo the collaborations of Techno Animal and Alec Empire.</p>\n<p>There are traces of the organic instruments Tobin previously used, especially in the orchestral swells that dramatize a few of the tracks. More often they're stitched into the frames, as with the rumbling double bass that forms the engine of &quot;Searchers&quot;. The later songs slow down for a series of drifting atmospheres punctuated by dubby upstrokes or hints of Brazilian percussion, and it's increasingly mind-boggling to believe that all the featured sounds originate from a sampler. But Tobin insists on his method, so we have to imagine that the plips and plops of &quot;Proper Hoodidge&quot; might have been guitar licks at some point, and that the ominous drone haunting &quot;El Wraith&quot; may have been a foghorn in a past life. Describing all the ethereal sounds flooding the beautiful closer &quot;Mighty Micro People&quot; would require a few hundred words alone.</p>\n<p><em>Out From Out Where</em>'s most dynamic workouts bounce along energetically, completely enamored of themselves; &quot;Verbal&quot; comes close to dopey big beat territory, with vocals from MC Decimal R diced into Prefuse and Chipmunks soundbytes. Tobin's definitely out to have some fun with this record, though the immense density of these soundscapes prevent them from being reduced to chop-shop filler. Unfortunately, he seems less interested in taking you on a journey, as each piece ends in roughly the same place as it begins. Where the pleasure lies here, however, is in listening to the rich layers unfold, and the music just glows, filled with his enthusiasm. Amon Tobin may never put out a party album, but this is probably as close as he's going to get.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>I was a bit wary of approaching Amon Tobin's new <em>4 Ton Mantis</em> EP. I was under the impression that when a label releases an &quot;EP&quot; consisting of a single, a remix of that single, a few remixes of another track on an already-released full-length, and one unreleased single, the purpose is simply to hype the given single and give club DJs some more danceable variations on tracks they've already been spinning.</p>\n<p>But Amon Tobin is a special case. In many ways, his music could be characterized as a remix of music in general, taking what he considers to be the most interesting elements of everything ranging from cheeseball spaghetti western soundtracks to blistering funk, and combining them to create something uniquely his own. Such is the case with the best remixes-- artists work with original music they didn't create to leave their own indelible mark on it.</p>\n<p>Roots Manuva's remix of &quot;Saboteur&quot; is a prime example of the remix as an artform. By weakening the rhythmic skeleton that held up the track in Tobin's original mix and adding a vocal track, Manuva has turned &quot;Saboteur&quot; into a song that, while completely different, is true to the original in spirit.</p>\n<p>UK DJ Bonobo's remix of &quot;4 Ton Mantis&quot; is equally compelling. Like Manuva, Bonobo has reworked the track from the rhythm up, shifting accents and re-shaping the song's percussive elements into a familiar yet decidedly original soundscape. The fact that these remixes work so well is testament to the amazing density of Tobin's music-- there are enough sonic nooks and crannies in his tracks that multiple DJs can remix them and come up with completely original results.</p>\n<p>Not to be shown up, Amon himself contributes one track to this EP, the excellent &quot;Yards.&quot; &quot;Yards&quot; is classic Tobin-- hyperactive, rhythmically complex, and funky as all hell. I find it deliciously ironic that Tobin has recently become the poster boy for intelligent dance music. Tracks like &quot;Yards&quot; make it abundantly clear that no intelligent human being would ever attempt to dance to this type of music, at the risk of winding up with a severe case of whiplash.</p>\n<p>So perhaps I misjudged this type of remix EP. Sure, like anything, the remix can be a tool of evil. But when left to an experienced professional, a remix can provide a fresh take on already-fresh material, and it just doesn't get much better than that.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Dear Amon,</p>\n<p>How are you? I am fine. My name is Billy. I am 8 and 5/8 years old (9 in 137 days). I like soccer and playing with my rocketships. Do you like pizza? I think pizza is the best food in the whole world, especially with lots of cheese. One time, my big sister Beth ate way too much pizza and she threw up right in front of a guy she had a crush on. She was so embarrassed that all she could do for a whole week was sit in her room and listen to Alanis Morrisette on repeat, saying, &quot;Isn't it ironic? Don't'cha think?&quot; She's a major dork and has cooties.</p>\n<p>I am writing because I think my brother Kevin is obsessed with you. My parents are really worried. Before <em>Supermodified</em> came out, he had this countdown calendar up in his room between a giant poster of the cover of <em>Bricolage</em> and a framed picture of you looking off in the distance. Every day, he would sit in his room and stare at that calendar and rip off a number exactly at midnight. I think it's creepy. He says you are &quot;the manifold deity of digital polyrhythms, descended upon this wretched corporeal shell of a world to illuminate the path to enlightenment through sonic perfection.&quot; He's really smart because he goes to college. Nobody understands what he's saying.</p>\n<p>Who do you think would win in a fight between a Velociraptor and Spider Man? I think Spider Man would, because he would use his spider sense to avoid danger, then wrap it up in super powerful webs. I think Spider Man is the coolest ever. One day, my brother Kevin got into a bad fight with his friend Eric. They both wear big pants and like those glow sticks that you use on Halloween and stuff. Anyway, Eric and Kevin were going to get into Eric's car and Eric wanted to listen to Roni Size. Kevin wanted to listen to your second album, <em>Permutation</em>. They got really mad at each other. Finally, Eric told Kevin, &quot;Dude, Amon Tobin is too weird and esoteric. At least Roni Size won the Mercury Prize. That must mean he's better.&quot; Kevin sprang at him really fast and started to claw at his face, screaming words like &quot;cretin&quot; and &quot;imbecile.&quot; This other time, my sister asked him why he didn't listen to more mainstream electronic stuff like Fatboy Slim and Moby, because they were so much cooler. I've never seen him so angry. He went off for like half an hour. He had just gotten <em>Supermodified</em>, so this is what he told her:</p>\n<p>&quot;You poor plebeian, devouring mainstream culture like so many Chalupas and Doritos. If you would simply pause for a mere second and lend an ear to the remarkably intricate and razor sharp compositions offered on <em>Supermodified</em>, you would become revolted at only the thought of such derivative drivel. Amon Tobin creates aural treasures each time he touches studio equipment. He breathes vitality into a stagnant genre with each drum hit. He rejuvenates the pallid genre of electronica every time he permits the world to glance through the twisted digital window of his music. Take the opening track, 'Get Your Snack On.' In even the inaugural morsel of the album, Tobin breaks new ground for funk-infused rhythms. It is easily the most addictive song he's recorded to date, replete with thumping bass line and ludicrous drum breaks. Then we have 'Saboteur,' a subtle epic that hovers on the edge of genius, yet is able to shatter walls in its sheer restraint from exploding into rhythmic madness. 'Deo' again presents an intellectual Amon Tobin who allows his tracks to evolve, weaving a elaborate oriental rug of organic tones and beats. I am literally contorted with giddiness when hearing certain sections of <em>Supermodified</em>.&quot;</p>\n<p>She tried to walk out of the room, but he chased her around the house with a boombox that was playing &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot; until my sister threatened to tell his girlfriend that he once said that &quot;Believe&quot; by Cher was &quot;sort of interesting.&quot;</p>\n<p>I sometimes get funny feelings when I listen to your music. On your other two records, it was different because I kind of felt alienated from the music. It was so weird and random and intense at times. Now, the music sort of draws me in and I can't stop listening. Kevin says it's because this disc is much more &quot;accessible than anything he's done before, yet it surpasses them insofar has he has shown the beginnings of a total sonic mastery of each subtle aspect of a work.&quot; Everything just fits together so well, like Lego blocks making a castle. It used to be that the beats would be really scary because they didn't quite fit the background music, but now everything is just so proper and seems in its place. Please help me, Mr. Tobin. I don't want to grow up to be obsessed with you like Kevin. I want to be able to leave the house sometimes when I grow up. I want to be a fireman! But I just can't stop listening now. Be kind, Mr. Tobin, I'm only 8 and 3/4 years old!</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>On the one hand, the name of this project by Kinski guitarist Chris Martin tells you a lot. The mere mention of the words 'amp' and 'buzz'; next to each other is a Pavlovian bell causing salivation in DroneOn list regulars, and Ampbuzz delivers on the promise of its name, with plenty of long, extended chords to be savored. And yet, if you were to venture to guess what <em>kind</em> of drone music you'd expect from a band going by the name, you'd probably think of something subdued and quiet, with tones only slightly less uniform than the ones emitted by kitchen appliances. Not so with <em>This Is My Ampbuzz</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead, this is dynamic, varied head music that looks back to the dawn of instrumental psychedelia for inspiration. Something about the vibe throughout the record seems very early 70s-- back when the Floyd and a few German pioneers were launching the longhairs into orbit. The retro vibe is apparent in the first minute of the album, as &quot;Bubbles&quot; opens with some heavily flanged keyboard squiggles that sound as though they come from a wire-ensnared black box the size of a small living room. The primitive nature of the synthetic devices on this track has a pleasantly historic trippiness that reminds me a little of Norwegian organist Bo Hansson's bent imaginary soundtrack to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>\n<p>Insofar as Ampbuzz is ambient, it's definitely on the darker side. The last three songs-- titled in sequence &quot;Diving Instructions&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Ocean Floor&quot;, and &quot;Underwater Bomb&quot;-- hint that this isn't going to be a &quot;let's drift gently through the clouds&quot; sort of ride. &quot;Diving Instructions&quot; is a slowburn track, as guitar feedback and cymbal clashes gradually merge into some kind of death rattle. And then &quot;Welcome to the Ocean Floor&quot; is claustrophobic with endlessly pulsating echoes, as guitar groans and synth pulses (there has to be an ARP 2600 in their somewhere) evoke a pea-soup thick tension. It takes me back to the first Experimental Audio Research album, another dense drone classic that sounded out of step at the time of its release. The closing &quot;Underwater Bomb&quot; does not detonate as promised-- instead we get a yearning keyboard drone coupled with some melodic, Ash Ra Tempel-style guitar leads on top.</p>\n<p>In a world of anal-retentive ambient laptop music, where each sound seems meticulously designed to seem 'alien' and difficult to place, Ampbuzz records an evocative instrumental album where all the sounds come from gear designed for making music. Guitars and assorted modular synths do the bulk of the work, I imagine, and the sleeve indicates that everything was recorded to \\xBD-inch tape. I'm not sure if it works in spite of its throwback nature or because of it, but these frayed and slightly crude tracks sound damn refreshing.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>There was a certain moment circa 1991 when, immersed and blissfully lost in The KLF Chill Out for the first time, a train outside my window suddenly began to barrel and cry as it passed through. As if in sympathy, so did my stereo, as the disc began to echo this outside sound with its own glissando of trains pulling through washes of keyboards and pedal steel, while somewhere in the miasma Elvis mumbled through the floorboards. It was then I realized not only the power of ambient music, but what it meant to make a music that could adapt to any and all sounds outside itself, something amoebic that could also swallow everything else.</p>\n<p>So when the coughs of my living room guest started to synch up with the fifth track of the first full-length from Swede Anders Ilar, I knew he must have been down with that early nineties school of thought, making his heavily-delayed electronics into something like a clear, deep golden broth that could hold all sorts of other sounds in suspension. A track like &quot;Rare Islands&quot; shows this connection to the decade previous, as Ilar lifts some of Aphex Twin's early wind chimes, and you can hear them mellifluously clang as he steals away ever so slowly. &quot;Coastline&quot; crackles to life with symphonic swells of bass, the crisp drums disappearing in rolling waves before coming back up to the surface. A lone strand of piano sustains throughout, vibrating beneath the radio static that surrounds it, keeping it afloat. &quot;Make Believe&quot; builds slowly, using a simple repeating pattern that scatters dubby debris about each step. Three minutes in, we happen upon a standard house beat, an odd discovery amid this snowy nowhere. In the distance, picturesque, grandiose melodies ring out, far enough away to be almost imagined, yet drawing your attention from the yawning thumps that stretch before you.</p>\n<p>The mistitled &quot;Illusion of a Summerbreeze&quot; instead conjures up winter and stuffy heads, combining a soft-palate tickle with post-nasal drip percussion as an odd wheezing hack darts through the mix. It's slightly annoying, but as the cold medicine goes to work over its ten minutes, its codeine sway makes operating heavy machinery (like CD players) inadvisable, better left to run themselves. It collides with the similarly medicated &quot;December Haze&quot;, downshifting soundforms to the point of pure, forelobe-fogging bass rumbles.</p>\n<p>Closer &quot;Everlast&quot; moves into the present, drawing from modern purveyors of electronic dreams like Ekkehard Ehlers or Christian Fennesz. &quot;Everlast&quot; makes a non-specific acoustic sound source shimmer on repeat, as each bit is elongated past the point of recognition, every pop and digital tear kept intact as it loops and melts. <em>Everdom</em> isn't exceptionally personalized, but Anders Ilar has obviously studied some of the masters, and will hopefully come with a more distinctly chilled ambient vision in the near future.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Very few record reviews contain much personal information, and that makes sense: what you care about is the music, and I'd just assume the occasional hatemail remain as vague as possible. But for you to appreciate the following, I need to tell you that I'm a slightly geeky Jewish male with an ambiguous relationship to Zionism and an aversion to second-hand smoke. Maybe my left-of-center bias in the current xenophobic climate should make for another rubber-stamp approval of Andre Afram Asmar's first desert-dub release on esoteric hip-hop label Mush. But let me put it this way: I am certain that at this very moment, this album is playing in dorm rooms where oppressed-person status, long attention span and sturdy lungs are a prerequisite for entry. That's not an ad hominem; every time I put this album on at home, I feel like I'm hanging out in a place where my kind is not wanted.</p>\n<p>The Palest-afarian photo collage in the liner notes reminds me of the walls of those oppressive college suites I naively thought I should enjoy chilling in. And though the streams of stoner-speak that open the first track, and the accompanying co-op basement drum circle, had me squirming right off the bat, the quality of the mix did keep my attention. But &quot;Camel Clutch&quot;, in which singer Elias is completely drowned out by a mess of reverbed percussion, is a sign of failures to come. Sure enough, for the rest of the album any stray musicality gets drowned out by a rhythmic mess so moist-- nay, sodden-- that I can hardly hear myself hate it. Is this what Andre means when he calls himself &quot;the mugician&quot;?</p>\n<p>More to the point, what is it about Asmar's mix of unarticulated victim politics, para-Rastafarianism, and spiritual exhaustion that I find so hauntingly annoying? It's one of the more familiar brands of college narcissism on the West Coast, and I should be used to it by now. Maybe more disturbing is that Asmar uses his Middle Eastern provenance not as a source of musical ideas-- Arabic vocal samples are mixed just like anything else into the loose dub textures-- but as a license to fairly drip with self-indulgence, as carte blanche for songs that don't go anywhere, built from stale beats, inane mantras, and extended gurglings. To make matters worse, someone in the control room is dead set on putting everything through the same cheap delay pedal, like the wild world of water sports without the wild, or the sports. Just wet.</p>\n<p>Capable experiments in mixing crop up once we leave the desert for a more tropical feel: straight-ahead &quot;Scientism&quot;, for example, starts with a clean, guitar-driven hook, then makes its way from reggae-in-the-club to dub-in-the-headphones with an uncharacteristic smoothness. In &quot;Duniagariba&quot;, traditional North African drumming melts into a braying hurricane, then congeals back into traditional drumming, deftly. Taken as a whole, though, these aimless jams herald no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub. Even Edward Said would nod off in no time. This is no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub, just the same old aimless weed-soaked jams. Mugician, indeed!</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Some of Norway's best producers seem to compensate for the region's chilly climate by gravitating toward sunny sounds, from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/\">Todd Terje</a>'s escapist lounge-house to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/\">Prins Thomas</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/\">Lindstr\u00f8m</a>'s psychedelic nu-disco. This can't be said for 28-year-old producer Andr\u00e9 Bratten. Although he records in the same Oslo studio as Terje, Thomas, and Lindstr\u00f8m, Bratten's new album <em>Gode</em> is insular and experimental, from conception to execution. <em>Gode</em> is Bratten's second proper full-length record, following 2013's inventively titled <em>Be a Man You Ant</em> and this past summer's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20634-math-ilium-ion-ep/\"><em>Math Ilium Ion</em> EP</a>.\u00a0It's also the most ambitious work of his career,\u00a0tackling social and historical injustices of the past\u2014namely the serf-like arrangement between farmers and landowners in early 20th-century Norway.</p>\n<p>Now, if you're thinking that a double LP about the pre-industrialized Norwegian agrarian economy isn't going to get club kids on the floor, you're right. But this time around that's not Bratten's goal. He wants to tell a story with specific historical context within electronic music, which is an inherently difficult task: A synth stab, field recording, or a programmed drum pattern, however well-conceived, doesn't translate to &quot;meditation on the darker days of Norway\u2019s past, before the country discovered its oil wealth,&quot; as Bratten <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2015/10/02/andre-bratten-gode-lp-smalltown-supersound/\">has said</a>.</p>\n<p>But even if you'd never guess the album's larger themes without reading about it, it's clear from the music that he's attempting something more evocative and wide-ranging. Bratten's production can recall everything from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/\">Aphex Twin</a>'s <em>Selected Ambient Works</em> to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/\">Andy Stott</a>'s murky experimentalism. He's cited <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Brian Eno</a> as an influence, as well as 20th century classical musicians like Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt, and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi\u2014known for creating music that plays off a single pitch that generates almost imperceptible microtonal oscillations. Bratten is resourceful at assembling whatever sounds or styles needed to fit the need of the moment: &quot;Primordial Pit&quot; uses mostly live instruments to create a sweeping, post-rock-like grandeur, while &quot;Ins.&quot;, the album's shortest track, is a dissonant string arrangement that is as beautiful as it is unnerving.</p>\n<p>For all this wandering, the most overtly pleasing songs on <em>Gode</em> are the ones that call back to Bratten's roots. &quot;Space Between Left &amp; Right&quot; has a techno pitter-patter that a patient nightclub crowd could easily appreciate, while the album's title track evokes <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/\">Boards of Canada</a> at their prettiest. Another clear highlight is &quot;Cascade of Events&quot;, which features the Norwegian pop singer <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30750-susanne-sundfr/\">Susanne Sundf\u00f8r</a>, who Bratten had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZ1OHj2VJY\">previously remixed</a>,\u00a0her voice shrouded in an analog haze. Having a voice like Sundf\u00f8r, who has had multiple number one albums in her home country, gives Bratten an anchor to chain his more experimental inclinations to; it'd be fascinating to hear Bratten paired with Sundf\u00f8r for more than one track.</p>\n<p>Given the intentions that <em>Gode</em> comes packed with, it's tempting to view its success in terms of that story. Does <em>Gode</em> accomplish Bratten's goal of creating a tribute to the farmers who never had the opportunity to make art because of their circumstances? Quite possibly! But like a museum plaque explaining abstract art to a layperson, background is only a tiny piece of a mostly visceral experience. What's easier to glean, and more universal, is that Bratten has made an expertly produced, emotionally honest record that defies genre and expectation. To understand that requires no homework.</p>\n",

But he also distinguishes himself with a sound you might peg as Teutonic before Scandinavian. While the likes of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/\">Prins Thomas</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5718-diskjokke/\">diskJokke</a> range over earth and space, none cover precisely the furrowed, cratered landscape Bratten claims. Featuring dark hues and rough crags, it inspires visions of low, ore-spined mountains. In an Oslo-producer family portrait, you'd imagine Bratten as the lurking one, in the black ribbed turtleneck, looking on severely as porn-mustached <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/\">Todd Terje</a> makes bunny ears behind <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/\">Lindstr\u00f8m</a>'s bucket cap.</p>\n<p>At six tracks, <em>Math Ilium Ion</em> looks like an EP, but its half-hour length and lack of filler makes it feel like an LP. Bratten consistently cultivates ominous tension, even as he instills a certain measure of stubborn optimism, pressing corroded frequenices into diamond-hard melodies. He avoids clear-cut builds and releases, laying parts with their own internal tension in rows and letting their ripple mete out catharsis. This is especially clear on &quot;Trommer &amp; Bass&quot;, where heavy basses and scissoring percussion seem to strike at a stationary target, with relentless assassin-like accuracy, for almost five minutes, until the hammering finally drops and glides.</p>\n<p>Bratten's music has a monstrous mechanical movement, but his tuned toms and chattering patterns are offset with live-feeling accents that rattle in the grid, giving the sense of someone striking a head in real space. The music feels wonderfully self-generative, as if willing itself into being. With its controlled speaker fry and choked-out melody, album highlight &quot;Yours Sincerely, Andre Bratten&quot; ingeniously un-crumbles together. Bratten's sounds don't just lurch in; they take shape before our ears. You can picture him slowly turning knobs to tame each wild tone into the groove, which is never far away, even when it decays into textured abstractions that keep alertly pushing it forward.</p>\n<p>Though many passages of <em>Math Ilium Ion</em> are highly kinetic, only &quot;Trommer &amp; Bass&quot; is ready for the floor. The record's games with time are clearly built with the listener in mind. &quot;The Little Things, Fools and Kings&quot; opens with a terrific little near-catastrophe. Many tiny elements seem to accelerate in at different rates but arrive simultaneously at the same place, to be promptly drawn taut with one oozing lump of saw waves. By the time we get to the two &quot;Misconception&quot; tracks, mutated rave overtones have subsided into something more like ambient house, deep and broad and full of subtle activity. Since we are fully immersed, it's welcome.</p>\n<p>The only thing even slightly bothersome about Bratten is that sometimes he doesn\u2019t quite nail the landings, which is strange since he takes so much care until then. The abrupt endings of several tracks are startling after all the subtle permutation we've been through, and a little unsatisfying. But that minor complaint really means that, when so much similar music is available, it's easy to stay invested in these long tracks all the way to the end. When the next groove is always one antsy keystroke away, that's saying something for Bratten.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Those choke-hazard tchotchkes Animals on Wheels no longer fascinate Andrew Coleman. Drill-n-bass has lost its appeal, too, over the years. Thus, Coleman has abandoned his former alias and style and is all the better for the switch. As Animals on Wheels, Coleman gave the world two albums of breakbeat encrusted noise, and as such, sat on the fringes of the Ninja Tune roster. Now recording for Thrill Jockey, Coleman finds himself comfortable, his avant-leaning precocity embraced by the label that also writes royalty checks for Mouse on Mars, Nobukazu Takemura, and Oval.</p>\n<p>Though trading in the frenetic energy of his Animals on Wheels' releases, Coleman is still pursuing juxtapositions. Whereas Animals on Wheels' <em>Designs and Mistakes</em>, and its less frantic successor, <em>Nuvol I Cadira</em>, sought to contrast wounding shards of breakbeats with warm fuzzy melodies, <em>Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt</em> looks for clashes between elegance and distortion. These distortions, created with antiquated 16-bit equipment and soundcards, imbue Coleman's gorgeous melodies with an aliased corona that works in harmony with the very appropriate title that Coleman has chosen for this collection.</p>\n<p>Emerging from low frequency waves, &quot;Too Early By Far&quot; pits white noise against a harmonium drone and a piano melody. Despite the white noise gathering supporters from the clapped-out percussion synth Coleman uses, the exuberant piano melody excels and is greeted at the end by a honking bass clarinet. &quot;Pi Four&quot; finds Coleman's piano trading lines with a frazzled, piercing, possibly guitar-in-origin figure, while a Boards of Canada-style rhythm ensures that all punches are above the belt. The crazy calliope of &quot;Escalator Apartment&quot; wrestles with a <em>Nuvol I Cadira</em>-ish breakbeat clatter.</p>\n<p>The Bucephalus Bouncing Ball melody and cracked percussion of &quot;Plot Lost Sixteen&quot; take me back to agitated Sunday afternoons, apparently lazy, but in fact fraught with nascent nastiness. &quot;Vocational Shouter&quot; recalls Aphex Twin's fuzzy masterpiece, &quot;Tha,&quot; with its anchorless, sinewy chords grasping for just a moment's coherence. &quot;Hang Up Season&quot; carries on the approximation of sense begun with &quot;Vocational Shouter.&quot; About the exerting synthline, shrill lines force their way in and out of the background like the angels of death from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.</p>\n<p>During &quot;Wider Ignorance,&quot; Coleman subverts a routine downtempo drum pattern by sideswiping it with electronic piano chords and a melody borrowed from Salvador Dali's mother's musical jewelry box. Closing the album with the spacious-but-weighty &quot;Curse of Knowing&quot; Coleman proves one final time that he's as fascinating a pianist as he is a drum machine operator. With <em>Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt</em>, Andrew Coleman has accomplished the fusion of avant-garde electronics and poetic pianism. Coleman serenely succeeds where Richard D. James' <em>Drukqs</em> faltered: Coleman wasn't faking when he came up with his album title.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A line from the ridiculously melodramatic but still quite enjoyable Godspeed You Black Emperor! track &quot;Dead Flag Blues&quot; goes, &quot;We're all trapped inside the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death.&quot; You ever wondered what it sounds like inside of this horrible machine? Not GYBE!, I'll tell you that. The guitar tone is too warm, for one thing, and what kind of hemorrhaging death trap has violins? With <em>Sprung</em>, Canadian techno artist Andrew Duke has crafted one possible soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Duke has been around for a while, but this album for French imprint Bip Hop is his first release to receive wide distribution outside DJ circles. Duke's m.o. is midnight black, clanging machine techno of the sort Richie Hawtin crafts when he's in the mood, and that Thomas Brinkman has perfected. Heavily inspired by the sounds of Detroit, Duke shares some of Drexciya's fascination with the techno/electro crossroads, but Duke's album is much further removed from the conventions of early hip-hop. Only the opening track, &quot;Hell Yeah&quot;, is really electro proper, and here Duke remains fixated on the gloomy, mechanistic attributes of the genre, like Cybotron with a dense coat of drop-forge grime. No way a joyous b-boy could pop 'n' lock to this thing.</p>\n<p>After this opening cut, <em>Sprung</em> takes a much more abstract turn. Most tracks are built on a series of highly repetitive loops that morph slowly over time, the patterns incorporating scrapes, hisses, and the occasional synth flourish. The recurring mental image I get when listening is the kind of comically complex machine Wile E. Coyote used to order from Acme, with dozens of dials, pipes, cords, wheels and other assorted devices popping out in every direction. With each new track, one of these massive top-heavy devices is set spinning, and as it wheezes and wobbles in place, the machine coughs up chunks of metal, fittings loosen, and fasteners give way. The racket swells and becomes chaotic before peaking and receding again.</p>\n<p>There's no mistaking how <em>alive</em> these death sounds are-- due in part to Duke's feel for structure. The sense of pacing is something to behold, as the tracks on <em>Sprung</em> remain in a state of perpetual motion, always either building or falling apart. Despite the loop-driven nature of the composition, these tracks never seem static, and as far as albums go, <em>Sprung</em> certainly seems fully realized. Still, despite its merits, I have to say that it's not often that I'll want to listen to something this ice cold and bleak from start to finish. In some respects, the tension inside the music doesn't quite reach the pitch it could, since the overall mood never wavers from a punishing sense of desolation. A few shafts of light might have made the darkness blacker still. But if you're in the mood to climb into the rusty innards of that iron beast, this is your ticket.</p>\n",

Though the choppy and sharp melody initially seems out of joint with the accompanying smooth, heady synth bass, the more repetitive it becomes, the more it settles in.</p>\n<p>Throughout this EP, Hung emulates the juxtaposing elements found in the nature of youth, a time in life when everything is confusing and you have to navigate a path through conflicting options. &quot;Repetition vs Time&quot; summons a childlike wonder and calm, with an intentionally cheesy chorus and boom-bap beats invoking nostalgia for playing keyboards in high school music class.\u00a0Towards the latter end, the song is more reminiscent of video game menu music than anything else, but perhaps this is intentional. Hung\u2019s littering of 8-bit grace notes is ultimately refreshing, and an apt ode to his work as one half of Fuck Buttons.</p>\n<p>&quot;That thing you want won\u2019t make you happy&quot; is distinctly melancholic in comparison to the rest of the record. It carries the melody of a more somber '90s boy band ballad, and closes with finger-picked acoustic guitar tinged with subtle reverb. &quot;Star Ferry Dub&quot; immediately starts off as a pounding antithesis to the previous song. It\u2019s heavy on the ears and on the heart, flashing a raw hedonism seldom found in the <em>Rave Cave</em> series. The song rings in the musical themes evident throughout the EP\u2014we are reintroduced to the 8-bit ornamentation of &quot;Repetition vs Time&quot; and that thumping arpeggiated bass echoing &quot;Ashill&quot;, but this time the ghosts of these tracks are more lingering and intense. There\u2019s so much going on at once that it\u2019s hard to pin down, but the complexities and wide sonic scape don\u2019t sound excessive or sloppily piled on top of one another. They\u2019re seamless, intricate, and intoxicating. Then, the imperfect cadence fades and stutters into oblivion, leaving the listener aching for more. Andrew Hung\u2019s story isn\u2019t over yet.</p>\n",

(Though as he has said, that choice was simply a convenient solution to the dearth of portable, easy-to-manipulate gear during Fuck Buttons\u2019 last tour.)</p>\n<p>Writing music on an obsolete gaming tool probably seems hopelessly antiquarian to some (especially if you grew up with the DS) but the uninhibited, high-strung music Hung wrings from it feels fresh. There\u2019s nothing here of the magnitude of their massive <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/\"><em>Tarot Sport</em></a> centerpiece &quot;Olympians&quot;, or the protracted leer of <em>Slow Focus</em>. The biggest and brightest moment is the irrepressible glitch-fest &quot;Korea Town&quot;, a gorgeous tide of bleeps and bloops, with romantically wafting strings laid on thick on top.</p>\n<p>The EP\u2019s other two tracks are harder-edged, built on heavily metronomic beats with just enough swing to stick. They\u2019re also nowhere near as pretty: The propulsive, bull-headed stomp &quot;The Plane&quot; is stippled with sharp, abrasive sound effects, pushing the rough equipment to an aggressive extreme. Hung also shows a punkish sense of humor, adding in an almost comically seasick warble partway through &quot;Fables&quot;. All three songs sound like a loose extension of the unconventional methodology that\u2019s driven Hung and Fuck Buttons bandmate Benjamin John Power\u2019s collaborative jamming.</p>\n<p>The EP also benefits from a handmade quality, one that you certainly wouldn\u2019t find on a Fuck Buttons album at this point. Hung and Powers have often worked with cheap equipment, from karaoke machines to children's toys, though they've shown an increasing focus on sound quality as the scale of their work has increased. Here, Hung's unvarnished approach serves to highlight themes that repeatedly creep into his work\u2014an underlying affinity for gear-grinding industrial sounds; a focus on process over a specific end result. In that sense, it's a welcome refresher.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Last year, Berlin-based producer Andrew Pekler toured with Jan Jelinek as part of the Kosmischer Pitch band. He's been making music under several names for almost a decade, first gaining notice in 2000 as Sad Rockets, releasing <em>Transition</em> on Matador when the label experimented frequently with electronic releases. Though he's not prolific by the standards of electronic music, Pekler's method reminds me a bit of Atom Heart or Burnt Friedmann: each record is meant to sound different, based on a considered set of aesthetic guidelines. Pekler's time hanging around Jelinek-- after having previously been his labelmate on ~scape-- seems particularly significant here on his latest record.</p>\n<p>For <em>Cue</em>, Pekler's M.O. was to assemble music using &quot;library&quot; records as inspiration. These are those weird LPs you now sometimes find in the &quot;Misc.&quot; section of record stores, containing music for royalty-free &quot;needle drop&quot; use in commercial applications. Pekler took descriptions of the intended effect for various tracks (&quot;slow, ominous piano motif drifting into swirling atmosphere&quot;), and built new tracks, attempting to arrive at these moods from another angle.</p>\n<p>Knowledge of his process is unnecessary for enjoying <em>Cue</em>. Pekler's use of such sterile material certainly contributes to the record's unusually disjointed feel, but these tracks don't seem tied to any particular era and certainly aren't meant for background use. His fondness for dense, overlapping loops as the basic unit of composition does, however, resemble the direction Jelinek has taken on his last two records, <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em> and <em>Tierbeobachtungen</em>. Each of these tracks sounds build from five or six or ten samples that are cut into pieces, set in motion, and allowed to bump into each other.</p>\n<p>This approach, while necessarily limited in terms of dynamics, results in a handful of very interesting tracks. &quot;Rockslide&quot; even edges toward brilliant, with a droning tone up front that seems to skim along the surface of the beat like a stone across water, its pitch bent into chord-like shapes that, heard over steady floor toms, even manage to get a pretty funky. Indeed, the sound of drums throughout is striking and weird in a good way-- the extreme aridity of the beats opening &quot;On&quot; is the sort of thing Steve Albini hears in his dreams, and the exceptionally spacious &quot;Pensive Boogie&quot; sounds like a sack of assorted percussion tumbling down the stairs in slow motion, with some of the sounds moving backwards.</p>\n<p>&quot;Vertical Gardens&quot; is one of the places where the samples show their age, the cheap synth outlining the chords evoking early electronics nostalgia in a manner reminiscent of the bubbly, bright electro-pop of Schlammpeitziger, but with an additional layer of abstraction. &quot;Mote&quot;, one of a few short interludes that take one idea and runs with it for a minute or two, gets a lot of mileage from some cut-up piano bits, sounding like a player piano with a shredded roll that has been left alone in a decaying ballroom.</p>\n<p>All in all, <em>Cue</em> is very subtle. Aside from &quot;Rockslide&quot;, none of the tracks leaps out and demands to be regarded, despite the widely varying use of textures, tempos, and layering. But it's the sort of record that gets more interesting the deeper you get inside, as its old and strangely disembodied samples assemble into something new and occasionally even fleshy.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In a genre-- ambient-- that tends toward the anonymous, Andrew Thomas is all but invisible. In both name and sound, Thomas, and his second full length, <em>Between Buildings and Trees</em>, seems like the product of a Random Ambient Artist Generator: a name you probably won't remember making music whose details you won't recall. All this despite Thomas gaining a foothold through repeat appearances on Kompakt's closely watched\u00a0<em>Pop Ambient</em> compilation series. Not listening to-- or more appropriately not really hearing-- <em>Between Buildings</em> would be a mistake, though, as Thomas has collected 40-plus minutes of patient piano melodies and delicate loops.</p>\n<p>It's easy to compare ambient music to nature; Thomas' album title certainly isn't shying from this language (his only other full-length is entitled <em>Fearsome Jewel</em> and adorned with a macro photo of grass).  <em>Between Buildings</em>, though, conjures something more refined and fragile, like stemware or, well, the type of nice champagne you might drink out of stemware.\u00a0Unlike on <em>Fearsome Jewel</em>, Thomas never saturates your speakers. <em>Between Buildings</em> seems far more interested in dusting airspaces, sprinkling sound around a room. Some majorly distended tones aside, there's very little bass on <em>Between Buildings</em>, which allows Thomas' wispy pianos to rise in the mix. It's a style that has often seemed too pale on the <em>Pop Ambient</em> comps, but spread over nine tracks it feels light and thoughtful.</p>\n<p>Thomas doesn't deal in monolithic movements-- perhaps they would scan\u00a0as too intimidating, or too sturdy-- and most of the tracks on\u00a0<em>Between Buildings</em> glide comfortably for four or five minutes. Parsing the individual compositions is a bit silly (it's difficult to imagine a situation in which you'd play just one) but Thomas' best moments usually come on the piano. &quot;Above the World So High&quot; moves from noir-y, stumbling progressions to a quiet, cleansing hum. Opener &quot;A Dream of a Spider&quot; builds a rhythm out of a hesitant, near-lurch. &quot;Net to Catch a Ghost&quot; (clearly there is a Random Ambient Track Titling App as well) is as threadbare and tender as its name suggests. <em>Between Buildings</em> often sounds like an album on which no two sounds ever come into direct contact.</p>\n<p>Even casual fans of ambient composition will recognize <em>Between Buildings</em>: It lacks for new methods, singular noises, or moods not relaxed and/or contemplative. Thomas' commitment to space, and the way his pianos and tones brush against it, makes <em>Between Buildings</em> consistently worthwhile. It would be wrong to say that <em>Between Buildings</em> beats this year's <em>Pop Ambient</em> installment,\u00a0but only because Thomas' light drifts are coolly incapable of any action quite so forceful.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Some artists fall ass-backwards into the zeitgeist, ending up there due to the singularity of their vision instead of any desire to remain abreast of current trends. The career of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/\">Andrew Weatherall</a>\u00a0is a product of his instinctual way of hearing, of feeling out sounds and slotting them together in unexpected ways. This is true of his work as a DJ, remixer, producer, and as a musician. Whenever he's surfaced at the forefront of a movement-- working with label and zine Boys Own in the early acid house days, helping indie and dance seep into one another via his seminal production on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/\">Primal Scream</a>'s &quot;Loaded&quot;-- he always played a part in actively devising those worlds. His career is marked by a continual reinvention as the most unassuming type of leader, although Weatherall would probably regard that description as a pejorative term, especially given the haste with which he flees from anything that could be described as a &quot;scene.&quot; Usually he doesn't even wait until his ideas reach critical mass, instead choosing to disappear in a puff of smoke, already lost deep in a broad range of new fascinations.</p>\n<p><em>Masterpiece</em>\u00a0is a 3xCD set in a series of the same name devised by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ministryofsound.com/\">Ministry of Sound</a>, which allows artists ample space to mix up past and present favorites. Weatherall chose to theme his mixes around his most recent club venture, A Love from Outer Space, conducted with his long-term accomplice Sean Johnston at a tiny dive bar in Stoke Newington in London. The simple manifesto of the club, &quot;never knowingly exceeding 122bpm,&quot; is roughly adhered to here, and has partially led to a coining of the term &quot;cosmic disco&quot; to describe the music played within its sweat-soaked walls. There's something about the whole package that neatly ties together Weatherall's approach to his work, from his bemusement in the sleeve notes about the &quot;cosmic disco&quot; moniker to the not inconsiderable fact that the club just ended its residency in Stoke Newington. Once again he's moved on just as the outside world is catching up, although we do at least have this memento to chew on and the promise of isolated ALFOS club nights across the globe.</p>\n<p>The name of the club is pulled from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=a.r.+kane\">A.R. Kane</a> <em>&quot;i&quot;</em> cut &quot;A Love From Outer Space&quot;, and versions of the track bookend this compilation. The opener is from Weatherall's new band with producer Timothy J. Fairplay, the Asphodells, and the third disc closes out with the A.R. Kane original. It's a fitting way to seal up both ends of\u00a0<em>Masterpiece</em>, because the influence of the semi-legendary dreampop outfit continually bobs to the surface, whether it's in the skysawing guitars of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/\">the Horrors</a>' &quot;Wild Eyed&quot; (presented here in its Weatherall remix) or through the sunken astral-dub of Aquarius Heaven's reworking of &quot;Decontrol&quot; by the Subs. It speaks highly of Weatherall's intuitive way of detecting musical sea changes that his club has been obsessing over A.R. Kane for the past two years. It's not hard to hear their influence weaving in and out of a number of acts (<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/\">Peaking Lights</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30373-dean-blunt-inga-copeland/\">Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/\">Tame Impala</a>) currently flitting between similar light and dark pop impulses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>So Weatherall's radar remains firmly intact, but all three mixes here additionally demonstrate his broad pallet and his idiosyncratic way of forging links between the underground and more populist fare. Weatherall is a big-picture thinker, who can step back from tightly clustered musical cliques to find common ground in the impeccable glide of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/\">Todd Terje</a>'s &quot;Ragysh&quot;, the ragged rock of Glasgow quartet\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4089-sons-and-daughters/\">Sons &amp; Daughters</a>, and the watery psych passages of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/\">Wooden Shjips</a>' &quot;Crossing&quot;. Anyone taking a cursory glance at the track listing might be befuddled at how it all works together, but that's a Weatherall trademark, a feeling he's often distilled when his name is affixed to record labels belonging to acts as diverse as\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/\">the Twilight Sad</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2163-james/\">James</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/\">My Bloody Valentine</a>. Like all the best mixes, the joins rarely show, and familiar tracks act as gateways into unexplored worlds, such as the impeccable slide from Weatherall's glacial reworking of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/\">Cut Copy</a>'s\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12890-sun-god-andrew-weatherall-remix/\">&quot;Sun God&quot;</a>\u00a0into Bulgarian producer Bogdan Irk\u00fck's raw minimalism on &quot;My Weakness&quot;.</p>\n<p>For Weatherall, all good DJ sets offer some form of education, whether it's being introduced to someone like Irk\u00fck or hearing a new twist on an older track, such as the reggae-ified version of Primal Scream's &quot;Uptown&quot; from the largely forgotten-about\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12024-beautiful-future/\"><em>Beautiful Future</em></a>. &quot;It's pompous to expect a history lesson when you go out [to a club], but that's how it should be,&quot; Weatherall says in the sleeve notes.\u00a0<em>Masterpiece</em>\u00a0also offers a few lessons on the current. Fairplay, in particular, offers a couple of impressive tracks, notably on a remix of &quot;The Final Reel&quot; that plays out like an instrumental version of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/\">New Order</a>\u00a0indulging all their\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1040-death-in-vegas/\">Death in Vegas\u00a0</a>circa &quot;Dirt&quot; fantasies. &quot;The Final Reel&quot; is balanced on the kind of line Weatherall frequently likes to tread, with its roots firmly in the underground he inhabits, but strung out with so many hooks that it could easily court a wider audience with the right push behind it.</p>\n<p>In a sense, that's the path Weatherall's talent has led him on throughout his career, causing demand to far outstrip supply in the intimate club experiences he cultivates. Small nights he's worked (Shoom, Sabersonic, A Love from Outer Space) blossom because of the sense of community and inclusion they create, where audio secrets don't remain that way for long and are excitedly shared with the wider world by those lucky enough to get through the door. It's why we're left with\u00a0<em>Masterpiece</em>\u00a0offering us further in-roads into Weatherall's current mindset, and it's why ALFOS was destined to end up overflowing with people banging down its door from the moment it was conceived. But this is the best kind of way to quit, before the buzz starts to fade, before the flab starts to show, before a sense of trading on past glories begins to kick in. Weatherall knows it's time to say goodbye when it feels like the rest of the world is looking over his shoulder. At least this album made sure we got some generous signposts left behind.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The musical avant garde is a broad spectrum, encompassing the most extremely austere minimalism and the most jam-packed maximalist statements, the most rigidly structured formalism and the most chaotic improvisation, sounds drawn from nature and generated by man. It's so broad as to render the very term avant garde meaningless as a descriptor, and yet we still know it when we hear it. Yannis Kyriakides and Andy Moor come from different zones of that spectrum, Kyriakides the formal world of electronic composition and Moor the wild world of art punk (with the Ex) and large ensemble free jazz (Corkestra), but their basic desire to color outside the lines is fraternal enough that the two have not only founded the Unsounds label together, they've also recorded an album together for their imprint.</p>\n<p>The setup is simple: Kyriakides does live programming and sound manipulation while Moor plays guitar and fiddles with a radio. The effect is something approaching minimalism, but too active to fully qualify-- it's actually quite similar the Gilbert/Lewis Wire side project Dome, and anyone who enjoyed that duo's third and fourth albums in particular is quite likely to enjoy this as well. Ex fans looking for an extracurricular fix might find themselves as puzzled as many Wire fans were after hearing Dome. But Moor's trademark six-ton razor-blade attack never makes itself known here-- instead he uses the instrument percussively or stretches out string noise to blend with Kyriakides' static-electric buzzes, twitters and crunches.</p>\n<p>The guitar sounds as if it's being torn asunder on &quot;Eel&quot;, a track that stretches and distorts the sound of knocking on the strings into a miniature replica of a black hole. On the other side of that singularity, &quot;Little Bittern&quot; is the sound of guitar leaking through a pinhole in the roof, dropping a particle at a time amid trebly buzzing and electronic sloshing noises. While some tracks are haunting, a few are too shapeless to do much harm, and tracks like &quot;Possible Wheels&quot;-- which drags fumbling percussive sounds out over four-and-a half-minutes-- are the most amoebic. It's these tracks that draw the album a bit past its welcome, but they're very little harm done overall.</p>\n<p>The reward for making it past &quot;The Eye on Its Side&quot; is great, however: the 10-minute closer &quot;Nocturnal&quot; is a haunting, suspenseful piece of music built around low-level string noise and a steadily tolling bass tone that sounds like the sort of timbre Harry Partch might have dreamed up on one of his oddball marimbas. It's a stunning conclusion that makes for the album's most affecting (the effect, in this case, being a profound fear of going into dark rooms) moment. <em>Red v Green</em> is a relentlessly abstract affair, but it still manages to get inside you more than many similar records, and it's a fascinating meeting point for two very different constituents of the modern avant garde.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>When Manchester's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/\">Andy Stott </a>dropped the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/\">Passed Me By</a>\u00a0EP in 2011, its sound was such a paradigm shift for the producer that it effectively obliterated all that had come before. A previous full-length and more than a dozen singles were rendered obsolete; this rang out as Stott's &quot;true&quot; sound and self. The bruising and bleak dirges were diametrically opposed to the dub techno of his earlier work,\u00a0its depth of bass aligned more with <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/\">Sunn O)))</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/\">Demdike Stare</a>.\u00a0Through albums like <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/\">Luxury Problems</a></em>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20021-andy-stott-faith-in-strangers/\">Faith in Strangers</a>, the silty sound palette evoked dour industrial spaces even as Stott\u00a0let in more and more light, primarily by folding in the voice of his onetime piano teacher Alison Skidmore. Much like one of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/\">David Lynch</a>'s blondes, she was the one beacon of light in human darkness.</p>\n<p>For most of <em>Too Many Voices</em>, it sounds like the end of that cycle, suggesting that the grimy sonic template\u00a0that defined Stott and earned him fans in noise and experimental circles the past five years ultimately might just be a phase itself rather than a final iteration. If anything, Stott sounds like <em>Blue Velvet</em>\u2019s Jeffrey Beaumont, pulled between those two worlds, still dabbling in dark, abrasive textures while also moving towards something airier. &quot;Butterflies&quot; best exemplifies that split. On the hand it keeps the sluggish rhythm that underpinned his previous tracks. But rather than sounding weighted by granite it feels untethered, the beat landing like ping pong balls instead of boulders. A melody shrieks through, but the mood is no longer foreboding and the effect more enervating than haunting. And where Skidmore\u2019s vocals once gave tracks such as this a thrilling contrast, against these thinner backdrops, now they are turned into mere wisps.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the tracks feel unfinished, such as &quot;Selfish,&quot; wherein Stott takes a preset that sounds like a monkey wrench on cheap plastic. It\u2019s the album\u2019s trickiest beat, bringing to mind early dancehall, early '00s grime and even a bit of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/\">Radiohead</a>\u2019s &quot;Idioteque,&quot; but Stott does very little with the beat or with Skidmore's voice, just speeding up and slowing down both elements.\u00a0&quot;\u00a0The distorted beat of &quot;On My Mind&quot; and gaseous synths might be the start of something, but Stott seems reluctant to add layers in-between. The inverse applies to the title track, with Skidmore\u2019s voice existing in multiples but with little around them. There\u2019s plenty of low and high end, but none of the gray in-between. It makes for an album that sounds more like backing tracks missing the singer and the song to complete them. If anything, <em>Too Many Voices</em> sounds like it has too few.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Andy Stott must thrive in limbo. For much of the last decade, the Manchester producer shifted restlessly between varied electronic niches. He darted from spartan techno to luxuriating dub and so on, releasing singles with the enthusiasm of a keen listener trying to stake his own artistic identity. In 2011, he claimed that place with unapologetic if muted audacity, issuing two immersive EPs within four months. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/\"><em>Passed Me By</em> </a>and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/\"><em>We Stay Together</em></a> flooded his self-made world of gray sounds and surface static with beats that, in retrospect, he seemed to have spent years learning and bending to his will. The deep house thuds of &quot;Cherry Eye&quot;, the footwork splendor of &quot;North to South&quot;, the slow-motion stutters of &quot;Execution&quot;: They all cohabitated within Stott\u2019s new twilit mode.</p>\n<p>The addition of Alison Skidmore\u2019s clarion vocals and Stott\u2019s evermore-aggressive rhythms only enhanced the ghostly environment of the masterful 2012 LP, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/\"><em>Luxury Problems</em></a>. Mixing field recordings, vocal takes, and an assortment of technical processes, Stott operated both inside an uncanny valley and within its inverse, making the artificial seem natural and the alien seem familiar. After more than a dozen releases, Stott could now call an approach\u2014a liminal state of the human and inhuman, of the driving and the drifting\u2014his own.</p>\n<p>On <em>Faith in Strangers</em>, Stott\u2019s first <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/modernlove/andy-stott-batillus-concrete\">substantive</a> <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19147-millie-andrea-drop-the-vowels/\">solo</a> release since <em>Luxury Problems</em>, he applies that kilned aesthetic to an expanding set of sounds and ideas. If that 2011\u20132012 trilogy found Stott codifying his style, <em>Faith in Strangers</em> is his attempt to stretch it by piggybacking that recent system onto his early adventurousness. It\u2019s a bold move, one made with a new vote of public valediction. <em>Luxury Problems</em>, for instance, began with its most instant hook. Her voice wrapped in a lacework of effects, Skidmore seductively repeated &quot;touch&quot; until Stott\u2019s shuddering beat fell in behind her. But <em>Faith in Strangers</em> starts with something that belongs more on the <a href=\"http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to67_philip_jeck_sand.html\">landmark sound-art label Touch.</a>\u00a0&quot;Time Away&quot; opens in silence, or at least the room tone of a field recording. A horn slowly intones one note, which decays against a bed of quiet and creepy field recordings. It\u2019s as though Stott\u2019s world breathed in the long-tone pieces of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9082-imagined-communities/4/\">minimalist composer Yoshi Wada</a> and exhaled them through his trademark filter of glitches, pops, and hazes.</p>\n<p>Skidmore\u2019s voice arrives for the second track, the stunning &quot;Violence&quot;, but it\u2019s reversed and filtered, pieces of her syllables simply cut off at the root. &quot;Clap your hands/ clap your hands,&quot; she sings as though to tease an audience about a beat that, nearly nine minutes into the album, has yet to arrive. When at last it does, the pulse is one of the most forceful of Stott\u2019s catalogue, the shuddering bass and snare snaps suggesting that the producer has now welcomed trap into his vocabulary, too. But it\u2019s damaged and distorted in much the same way as all Stott sounds. He pulls new influences into his fold without allowing them to push him outside of his preordained spheres\u2014a nightclub built with pillows and wired with headphones, or a narcotics den affixed with mirror balls and strobe lights.</p>\n<p><em>Faith in Strangers</em> starts soft and light, only to have Stott gradually amplify the energy across its 54 minutes. By the time the record enters its second half, it\u2019s climbed from half-graceful, half-spectral footwork to minimal rhythms rattled by enormous bass and lurid synths. And then, on &quot;No Surrender&quot;, an organ run that suggests the house music at Timothy Leary\u2019s Daheim Castle introduces a catastrophic beat. The kick pounds and snares pop through a sheet of static, moving as if they\u2019ve ruptured every speaker system upon initial impact. Stott applies that distortion to the splintered IDM of &quot;How It Was&quot; and, most tellingly, to the remarkable &quot;Damage&quot;.</p>\n<p>The meat of that aptly named number is an enormous, bass-backed melody, the exact sort of chirping hulk that turned <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/\"><em>TNGHT</em></a> into <a href=\"http://warp.net/records/tnght\">a set of five adrenaline injections</a>. For Stott, though, it\u2019s just another plaything, an element to drag into his mix. He lets the hook blow out until it\u2019s degraded into low fidelity, and he surrounds it on all sides with caustic noise. The harsh cymbal splashes at the start recall <a href=\"http://www.max-neuhaus.info/menu.html\">a Max Neuhaus experiment</a> with drums, the clipped ending the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAQESTUHqSQ\">manic cut-ups of Hrvatski.</a>\u00a0&quot;Damage&quot; is the shortest and most magnetic song on <em>Faith in Strangers</em>, Stott\u2019s real shot at a legitimate single. But he rejects the notion wholesale, as though boasting that the rubric he\u2019s rendered simply won\u2019t allow something so straight.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, Stott has not only cemented his approach but also upped his ambition, moving from a producer who made disjointed singles to a musician hoping to craft albums with unspoken narrative action. &quot;It sounds clich\u00e9 to say a \u2018journey,\u2019 but it\u2019s got to be a story in some sense,&quot;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/andy-stott\">he told Tiny Mix Tapes of this LP.</a>\u00a0&quot;It does intensify from start to finish.&quot; At this point, actually pulling that off remains Stott\u2019s main challenge. Despite his increasingly disciplined and unified technique, <em>Faith in Strangers</em> can feel disorganized when taken as a whole. The intended arc from invitation toward aggression occssionally scans more as zigs and zags between a few distinct suites. Still, the separate moments are astounding, evidence of a musician who has managed to remain inquisitive even as he\u2019s established his signature.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Andy-Stott/262174253793725\">Andy Stott</a> took his time getting here. The Manchester producer spent a good part of the last decade turning out solid tracks under his own name and under the alias Andrea. Though he always returned to dub techno, he flirted with a range of genres, from juke to house to dubstep, and some of his music was very good. But Stott never quite zeroed in on a unique voice. That changed in 2011 with the release of two short albums, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/\"><em>Passed Me By</em></a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/\"><em>We Stay Together</em></a>. Stott left behind the quicker tempos of dance proper, and slowing down allowed him to sink deeper into his music, where he found a new world of atmosphere and texture. <em>Passed</em> and <em>Stay</em> were <em>heavy</em> records that highlighted something new about the expressive power of bass. Dub techno, stretching back to its origins with the early-1990s Berlin project <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/\">Basic Channel</a>, tends to view the low end as a mysterious black sludge. Where bass in <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/\">Skrillex</a>-style EDM is a precision weapon, with drops punctuating the tracks and jacking up the mood in an instant, the bottom octave in dub techno is more of an enveloping presence. It's murkier, more oppressive, colder, something you wade through and push against. Which is why the inertia of the relentless 4/4 beat signifies energy whatever the tempo.</p>\n<p>On his two 2011 releases, Stott found an unusual musicality in deep, foreboding bass. His music throbbed with the sooty remnants of industry and had obvious appeal for those interested in dark ambiance of any stripe; its all-consuming nature gave him a new audience beyond the realm of dance music. With his new album, <em>Luxury Problems</em>, he adds a few more wrinkles, and his music has become simultaneously more complex and more accessible. Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore (<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8973-andy-stott/\">Stott met her</a>\u00a0as a student when she taught him piano), he's humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward for the producer.</p>\n<p>Skidmore's voice is a versatile instrument in its own right, but Stott's looping and processing gives it even more flexibility. Though <em>Luxury Problems</em> has a consistent overall mood, the feel and structure of the individual tracks vary quite a bit, and the pieces featuring Skidmore find her singing pulled into all kinds of interesting shapes. The album opens with her in her most glassy and ethereal, as repetitions of her singing a single word, &quot;touch,&quot; float through space like soap bubbles. The &quot;ch&quot; phoneme is looped and becomes the hi-hat on the track, and gradually the sounds assemble themselves into a ghosted version of a conventional dance rhythm. But when Stott's machine bass pulse enters just under halfway through, we realize we're in for a world of serious contrasts: <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14306-numb/\">&quot;Numb&quot;</a> is delicate and gorgeous but has an undercurrent of menace, and the tension between these qualities is the record's essence.</p>\n<p>If &quot;Numb&quot; is Skidmore at her most spectral, &quot;Hatch the Plan&quot; finds her sounding more grounded, almost in the mode of a singer-songwriter. The choral-like layering on &quot;Plan&quot; brings to mind School of Seven Bells and even Throwing Muses. But it's the longest track on the record and is purely instrumental-- mostly a deeply unsettling mix of bass churn and machine noises-- for its first two minutes. That it moves from pure soundscape to something close to a proper song is further evidence of Stott's confidence; none of these tracks feel like they have to be any one thing, they're always growing and changing and defying expectations.</p>\n<p>&quot;Lost and Found&quot; has a similarly melodic approach, unspooling in a Middle Eastern mode and bringing to mind <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/\">Dead Can Dance</a> at their most subtle. We can hear Stott drawing lines between 4AD-style gothic new wave and dub techno, building bridges between sounds and ideas based on his understanding of the elements and moods that connect them. Elsewhere, on &quot;Expecting&quot;, he goes further into abstraction, constructing an intensely dark and ominous atmosphere that bring to mind the ice-cold isolationist drone of <a href=\"http://www.koener.de/\">Thomas K\u00f6ner</a>. The excavation of electronic music history takes a more unusual turn on &quot;Up the Box&quot;, which plays with a snippet of what sounds like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac\">the &quot;Amen&quot; break</a>. But the familiar splash of jungle snares and cymbals is transformed by Stott into something of his own own, as he mixes the tricky rhythms with his now undeniable bass signature, a groaning maw flecked with distortion that feels like it's rattling everything within earshot. Stott has a rare ability to pull sounds from different places and fit them into his album conception.</p>\n<p>Two records from the past offer antecedents for Stott's breakthrough: <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2560-luomo/\">Luomo</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/\"><em>Vocalcity</em></a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/\">Burial</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/\"><em>Untrue</em></a>. It's not that <em>Luxury Problems</em> sounds like either of these releases-- the mood and textures are vastly different in each case. But there's a spiritual connection between the three, all of which found producers working within the confines of a specific genre of electronic music discovering a way to turn their music inside and out and broaden its appeal through the manipulated voice. But if <em>Vocalcity</em> was a digital refraction of house music and <em>Untrue</em> took early UK dubstep as a jumping-off point to express post-club emptiness and yearning, <em>Luxury Problems</em> is more internally focused, an evocative and immersive soundtrack for a sustained look within. It's the headphones album of the year from a producer with a long history who has come into his own.</p>\n",

You can bet that in the fast-zombies-versus-slow-zombies debate, Stott sides with the groaners and stumblers: As was his previous record, <em>We Stay Together</em> is a Frankenstein's monster pieced together from scraps of club tracks pitched down to an agonizing crawl. Funny things happen at this speed: The beats lurch violently, kicking up clouds of ash with every impact; every syncopation becomes a hesitant shudder. Sampled vocals, looming in the background, turn to a jellied groan.</p>\n<p>The record begins rather demurely with &quot;Submission&quot;, five minutes of choral samples and ambient flutter that suggests the sound of a thousand pigeons ruffling their feathers in a catacomb. &quot;Posers&quot;, which follows, sets up the idea that will maintain across the rest of the record, with a slowed-down railroad chug, tri-tone strings, and dissonant washes of synthesizer; distant horns sound the mournful call of a failed hunt. Despite the leaden drowsiness, it still moves: There's an infectious sense of groove in its shuffling percussion and echoing finger snaps.</p>\n<p>After &quot;Posers&quot;, the record's fastest track-- around the same tempo as many of the slow-motion house and disco records being produced by artists like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/\">John Talabot</a>, Kassem Mosse, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28242-blondes/\">Blondes</a>; it only feels slower, thanks to its blasted, narcotic production-- things get really torpid. Not just sluggish, but also nasty and mean, degraded and depraved, with more of that death-gurgle bass that led me to compare Stott's last record to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/\">Sunn O)))</a>. If anything, <em>We Stay Together</em> sounds even more like it could have been released by <a href=\"http://www.southernlord.com/\">Southern Lord</a>.</p>\n<p>On vinyl, <em>We Stay Together</em> serves a two-for-one purpose: It's meant to be played at 33, but if you speed it up to 45, most of the record's tracks actually become punishing, industrial-strength techno, the kind of sledgehammers associated with Berlin's famously intense Berghain club. Even played like this, though, they don't sound like &quot;normal&quot; techno: they're warped, muted, blown out-- they sound <em>wrong</em>. &quot;Bad Wires&quot; becomes like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/\">Surgeon</a> being run through a cubic meter of boiled wool; the clanging &quot;Cracked&quot; comes to sound like several dub techno tracks being played in parallel, with rhythms so disorienting you may wonder if Stott simply sampled a particularly hairy passage from an old DJ mix and slowed it down by 30%.</p>\n<p>There's another reason to get this record on vinyl: It sounds way, way better. That might seem odd, given that so much of Stott's sound has to do with using compression, distortion, and other effects to make his music not just strange but even ugly. But, on wax, his swollen low end growls in a way that's almost sensual. (If you must buy digital, pay the extra bucks for the FLAC version; the difference between the high-bitrate version and a compressed MP3 is very real.)</p>\n<p>Despite the surface similarities between <em>We Stay Together</em> and <em>Passed Me By</em>, it doesn't feel like Stott is repeating himself. Both records may seem like hellish vultures picking over the carcass of dance music, but every track on the new record yields fresh morsels. Fans of Stott's labelmates <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/\">Demdike Stare</a>, and all the other goth-n-screw artists out there at the moment, will be happy to gnaw on these bones.</p>\n",

            "body": {
                "en": "<p>Exuberance is dance music's usual purview: ecstasy, adrenaline, abandon without end. But there's a whole subset of club music that dedicates itself to the inverse of what we're expected to seek amidst a sweating, heaving crowd-- loneliness, terror, misery, dread. This isn't a new phenomenon; Simon Reynolds has written of how the collective serotonin depletion that followed Britain's acid house effusions turned breakbeat hardcore and drum 'n' bass down darker paths. That music, at least, continued to engage the body, as does its direct descendant, dubstep, thanks to breakneck tempos and spleen-crushing bass.</p>\n<p>Enter Andy Stott. The Manchester-based DJ and producer is no stranger to dance music of the most visceral kind. In the latter half of the 2000s, he was best known for steely, speaker-destroying dub techno. Recently, especially under the pseudonym Andrea, he's tried his hand at shuddering, breakbeat-fueled dubstep and 160-BPM juke. But on a new album for Modern Love, he reinterprets techno in dirge-like fashion, slowed to a funereal shuffle and weighted down by a lead blanket of reverb. The term &quot;death disco&quot; has never felt so apt.</p>\n<p>It's a modest album, just six tracks and a short, introductory sketch-- some 33 minutes in total. It's the tempos that you notice first: his 4/4 thump moves sluggishly, like a 12&quot; 45 spun at 33 or even slower. House and techno usually lope along at somewhere between 120 and 130 beats per minute; Stott paces his tracks at 100, 90, even 80 BPM. Forget &quot;peak-time&quot; club music: these are trough-time beats. And it's not just a question of speed; every sound is warbly and unstable, like a warped record pitched way, way down. Handclaps and hi-hats crumble into bit-crushed detritus; kick drums and bass frequencies turn to a jellied slush, like solid ground liquefies during earthquakes.</p>\n<p>The murky sonics often recall Philip Jeck, who uses vintage turntables with a 16-RPM setting to attain an otherworldly rumble. On a couple of tracks, ethereal female vocals float hazily over the top; &quot;Execution&quot; is suffused with a gravelly death gurgle that wouldn't be out of place on a Sunn O))) record. A pervasive hiss and crackle drives home the idea that we're trawling the depths of vinyl's pockmarked grooves, like one of those microscopic photos that turns a record into a lunar landscape.</p>\n<p>Dissonance makes it even more hair-raising. &quot;North to South&quot; plunges darkly careening tones-- a Doppler-effect buzz with the skid of braked vinyl-- through bright, queasy synthesizers. (Kompakt fans may hear an echo of Wolfgang Voigt's M:I:5 project.) &quot;Intermittent&quot; revels in the seams as it patches together strings, bells, and vocal fragments into a rough-cut collage. In the song's last few bars, you can hear Stott's debt to disco edits as he finally lets a tightly cropped loop unfurl into a full phrase of music that, sped up, is recognizable as 90s R&amp;B.</p>\n<p>Only one track doesn't fit the mold: &quot;Dark Details&quot;, which throbs at dubstep's quickened pulse. Still, even here, the percussion's muted clang gives the impression of hearing a rave piped in via plumbing-- some club, miles away, suddenly bubbling up from your sink, and stinking of muck. Like a counterbalance to its uncharacteristically spry tempo, &quot;Dark Details&quot; is followed by the slowest tracks on the album, the demonic &quot;Execution&quot; and the torpid &quot;Passed Me By&quot;, a song so bleak it could make Burial look optimistic by comparison.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, Burial: you couldn't not mention him, really. Burial's haunted melancholy certainly paved the way for Stott's even more despondent take on dance music, and Stott is hardly alone in his doomsayer's approach. You can hear similar sounds and affect in Shackleton, Raime, Holy Other, and in moments of Demdike Stare, a project of Stott's label-mate Miles Whittaker. But where Burial and Shackleton use the flickering syncopations of dubstep and garage to keep their music moving, Stott's 4/4 beats, reduced to a deathly crawl, give his music an even more hopeless cast. &quot;Drag,&quot; the name associated with Salem's style of music, would be apropos-- suggestive, as it is, of a body being towed, or a boulder pushed uphill. Where club culture mythologizes a circuit of endless nights and after-parties, <em>Passed Me By</em> suggests physical and spiritual exhaustion, Sisyphus collapsing beneath the dead-eyed twinkle of the disco ball.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Andy Votel has been knocking around the UK blunted beatz scene for a while now, and for the most part, he's not been just another stoner stinking up post-production studios with antique Adidas purchased online from a Shibuya-based retro-chic boutique. Since his 1995 remix of Mr Scruff's &quot;Sea Mammal,&quot; Votel has achieved acclaim for turning Badly Drawn Boy from a thrift-store Jamiroquai into an award-winning George Harrison substitute.</p>\n<p>Setting aside the arrogance of the title, the seven tracks on this EP offer no great leaps in form, no turning of the tables of the money changers, no brave new vistas for the rest of us cloth-eared schlubs to follow on wide-eyed. The blunted beats here have long since made their way into the vernacular of TRL-pop and high-cost consumer durable commercials.</p>\n<p>After a brooding start, the rinky-dink Rosemary's Baby melody of &quot;Urbanite Rocks&quot; rides through a devastated cityscape where malformed infants cruise around in leper-pushed carriages in search of parents, sources of nourishment, and sunlight. &quot;Girl on a GoPed&quot; renews Votel's partnership with Jane Weaver in a Pram-for-Dido-fans style. Weaver kittenishly purrs about a &quot;slinky little number&quot; while Votel frames her in chiming glockenspiels, the revving sounds of Vespas, and dollar-store organ lines.</p>\n<p>The conservatoire-trained, romantically swollen pianist who drops in and out of &quot;Return of the Spooky Driver&quot; is stubborn against the blasting surf guitar punks that intend to rid the planet of such academic prettiness. Can the two reconcile their differences? Is this track big enough for both styles? Votel fades the song out with the punks. Who knows where the pianist's body has been dumped?</p>\n<p>If the Coen Brothers feel like following up the bluegrass adventures of Ulysses Everett McGill, what better theme song could they wish for than the jaunty banjo twang and xylophone clank of &quot;Pickpocket?&quot; And the ostentatious production of &quot;Diode&quot; allows us a glimpse of what Tortoise might sound like if they recorded for Grand Central. Along identical lines, &quot;Doe-Eyed&quot; is the fuzzy gamelan of Macha packaged for the sneaker-conscious. <em>Styles</em> then closes with Lee Gorton's world-weary, work-shy, cello-accompanied vocals on the oddly constricted &quot;RiderBrow.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Styles of the Unexpected</em> does little to rid me of the notion that Votel's sole intent behind it was to release something-- anything-- on 10-inch vinyl. Having been recently discovered as God's preferred format for the storage of musical information, Votel likely thought he'd give the Old Man something new to stroke his gray beard to. Knowing that Speaka's far more worthy <em>Bespoke</em> album couldn't be fit on anything less than a 12&quot;, Votel felt as though these seven tunes would ring out as sound as a pound. I don't want to speak for God in this matter-- after all, he has his own unique ways of displaying favor or annoyance-- but I'll keep <em>Bespoke</em> spinning long after the so-called <em>Styles of the Unexpected</em> have worn out their meager novelty.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Anenon's <em>Petrol</em> is bookended by the sounds of freeway noise, so you don't have to look very far to find the meaning behind the title. But it's fortuitous that the album, with its viscous, reverberant swirls of reeds and violin, has the same dusky resonance as the <a href=\"http://www.colourlovers.com/color/18515E/petrol_blue\">color</a>. If this is an album about Anenon's native Los Angeles, the setting is somewhere just past sundown, the sky steadily leeched of color as lines of cars streak toward the horizon like rivers full of embers.</p>\n<p>Anenon is Brian Allen Simon, an electronic producer and saxophone player, and <em>Petrol</em> is his third album. It represents a major step forward for him. His debut, 2012's <em>Inner Hue</em>, evoked Tycho and the Field in its shimmering ambient sketches and crisp drums; 2014's <em>Sagrada</em> went further in its pursuit of a new kind of beat music composed using acoustic instruments, Fender Rhodes, and tons of reverb.\u00a0But its rhythms lacked distinction\u2014&quot;Lights and Rocks&quot; was basically an Aphex Twin pastiche, and the TR-808 sounds elsewhere on the album seemed out of place\u2014while his saxophone melodies sometimes scanned as rote.\u00a0But\u00a0<em>Petrol,</em> a looser, messier album, does a better job of communicating new ideas, and its emotional depth feels less gestural and more genuine.</p>\n<p>The album's raw material comes from an improvisation session alongside violinist Yvette Holzwarth and bass clarinetist Max Kaplan; back in his studio, working with the drummer Jon-Kyle Mohr, he reworked those tapes, cutting and resampling them into their final, hybrid electronic form. The opening &quot;Body&quot; is typical for the album, with cool, analog-style synthesizers and the humming of distant cars creating a buoyant cushion for Simon's melancholy saxophone riffing. The mood is evocative of Vangelis' <em>Blade Runner</em> soundtrack, but elsewhere things are less placid and misty-eyed; the drums on &quot;Once&quot; and &quot;CXP&quot; \u00a0recreate the head-over-heels tumble of drum 'n' bass, inspiring greater urgency in Simon's sax work. &quot;Mouth&quot; and &quot;Petrol,&quot; meanwhile, bring to mind Philip Glass' work. Simon has described how the album was partly inspired by the experience of standing on a pedestrian walkway above the freeway\u2014&quot;I found a sense of Zen in that as I was making the record,&quot; he told the <a href=\"https://uk.thefader.com/2016/01/20/anenon-interview-petrol\">Fader</a>\u2014and it's easy to hear parallels between the spinning chrome wheels his music evokes and the sped-up <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PirH8PADDgQ?t=1m21s\">industrial choreography</a> of the Glass-scored <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em>.</p>\n<p>But some of the finest moments on <em>Petrol</em> turn out to be the simplest. &quot;Hinoki&quot; is nothing but two minutes of downcast sax melody over fathomless reverb, and &quot;Panes&quot; takes a similar idea and adds a bassline fashioned from bleating bass clarinet. In the first few seconds of &quot;Panes,&quot; a human voice is briefly audible\u2014as far as I can make out, it says &quot;Maybe&quot;\u2014before it disappears into the murk again. It's the only voice on the album, but its appearance seems fitting; if <em>Petrol</em>'s twin themes are the way that cars and distance define the experience of Los Angeles, that snippet of speech is what creates a sense of human scale before the album's lonely denouement, when everything that has come before disappears beneath the din of freeway noise.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>For gray days, there is gray music. I don't know why I wanted to walk outside today anyway; it was humid and about to rain. It wasn't a particularly interesting day; nothing much to see except the same old pulse of the same old engines zipping past me on their way to some place that could never matter. It would have been a depressing day had I cared enough to pay attention. But in fact, it wasn't depressing at all. The footstep beats of those cars, and of the change in my pocket when I reach down to make sure I still have something to put in the newspaper dispenser, ensured that whatever wandering train of thought I carried didn't veer too far within. For gray days, there is gray music, and I'm glad I brought along <em>Pasada Professional</em>.</p>\n<p>Spanish DJ and modern techno producer Angel Molina has done more than his part for this kind of gray. <em>Pasada Professional</em> is a mix featuring artists from the Argentinean label Fragil Discos. The general sound is close to the Kompakt/Force Inc. style of minimal techno, with soft house beats and ambient textures providing sparse color. Of course, this is not exactly &quot;dance&quot; music, in the same way that Herbert's <em>Around the House</em> isn't necessarily dance music, but it comes from a similar place, and in these gray days, that's enough to get going.</p>\n<p>However, unlike most microhouse (there, I said it), Molina's mix is less concerned with keeping the beat alive than it is sculpting ebb and flow from its sources. As it happens, there isn't a beat to be found until the fourth track, and even then, you have to catch it on your own as Leo Garcia's &quot;Clap 4&quot; only implies it at first. Prior to that, Molina eases into a pulse, using a high-pitched bell tone from Pablo Reche's &quot;Campanitas&quot; and the fuzzy, mechanical hum of Audioperu's &quot;Ciao Morocco&quot; to introduce his own fuzzy, mechanical vision. Romina Cohn's &quot;Let's Rock (Voz)&quot; is straight glitch-noise growl, while Andy Love's &quot;Andy Loops&quot; drastically slows down a sample of Andy Warhol that some listeners will recognize from David Bowie's homage to the legendary pop artist. No beats, not even gray ones.</p>\n<p>Those don't really appear until Molina brings out his &quot;heavyweights,&quot; like Kompakt's Leandro Fresco, who gets two tracks on <em>Pasada Professional</em>. &quot;Pol-Pol&quot; seems pure Cologne, despite its South American origins. Imagine Kraftwerk removing the few human traits they exhibit (including playing synthesizers) and opting instead for bleak, almost colorless textures using only a couple of hazy loops and vinyl crackle. Alternatively, imagine Fennesz and Philip Jeck collaborating on a house track, vowing never to get louder than the doorbell. Pommerenck's &quot;Diacido&quot; evaporates out of &quot;Pol-Pol&quot;, using two watercolor chords as its backbone and keeping the tick-tock from the previous tune. Fresco returns with &quot;Pasta de Cristal Congelado&quot;, sounding relatively extroverted in comparison-- though in truth, it's merely the beautiful music of passing trains and sunsets. As these samples die, so does the track, and &quot;Diacido&quot; halfway returns, removing its harmonic weight in favor of beat afterthoughts like missed trains.</p>\n<p>Romina Cohn's &quot;Angel&quot; brings in an erratic glitch, like a broken Casio working just well enough to hint at some ages-gone programmed melody destroyed because someone left the floppy on top of the television too long. It carries over into Fantasias Animadas' &quot;Ascensor de Aluminio&quot;, so much so that it's hard to really tell where one track ends and the other begins. Throughout <em>Pasada Professional</em>, Molina delights in blurring the lines between tracks, and his sense of pacing seems to favor mood and atmosphere over pure beatmatching.</p>\n<p>My only complaint is his inclusion of Ocio's downtempo chill track, &quot;No es Palabras Escritas&quot;, at the end, as it seems to jump out from nowhere. But even so, the final track featuring only children walking and singing seems a perfectly enigmatic way to close a perfectly enigmatic mix. For bright days and nights, there is plenty; for gray areas, <em>Pasada Professional</em> seems right.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>At a sweaty, smoky loft-party in Williamsburg recently, amid frequent costume changes and disengaged dance moves, a coed troupe of new-wavers droned about aliens over pre-programmed beats. About halfway through the charade, a friend turned to me and said they reminded him of N*Sync. &quot;Maybe, but not as sincere,&quot; I replied. <em>All Your Faded Things</em> shares topical aesthetic similarities to this Brooklyn nightmare, but Anna Oxygen escapes all that empty, pop-art falsity. She's also got a knack for solid songwriting, infusing her lyrics with thrift-store-romantic touches and constructing emotionally resonant quote/unquote electroclash.</p>\n<p>Though surviving mainly on a diet of low-impact, easily consumed paint-by-number moves, Oxygen has a great voice and an eccentric sense of melody, picking odd syllabic pairings and juxtapositions, gruffly sweet intonations, and complex vocal patterning. Placing her operatic gestures atop pom-pom drum machine blips and busy keytar, her timbre is topically similar to Wynne Greenwood of Tracy + The Plastics, but she indulges in fewer Galas octave sweeps; instead, like Siouxsie raised on Freddy Mercury, she ooh's and ahh's finely layered Queen-styled vocal choruses intermixed with a few creepy Nina Hagen chirps. (Showing range, her contributions to The Microphones are more Mirah-subdued.)</p>\n<p>This sounds okay, but then, alas, enter the gimmicks. Much like Greenwood or Miranda July, Oxygen twists her work around an interactive live show including thrift-store DIY theater and visual projections. Content-wise, she says the majority of her songs are about a story involving a space scientist who captures girls' universes and puts them in petri dishes where he can listen to them and vicariously experience their lives: &quot;Each new imaginary girl-world I came up with became a motivation for me to make up a new soundtrack to go along with it.&quot;</p>\n<p>This is fairly similar to Greenwood's reason for creating Tracy + The Plastics in 1999: &quot;It started as the soundtrack/characters of this choose-yr-own-adventure-murder-mystery movie I was writing about these girls who called themselves The Plastics and ran a pawn shop in this dreary little town at the foot of these mountains. They replaced parts of themselves with hypercolorful pieces of plastic that fell from the towns on top of the mountains, above the cloud cover.&quot; Recycled tropes and pop music go hand-in-hand, but when similarly paced Pacific Northwest one-woman bands offer a common framework, the incestuousness of this sort of music is lamely apparent. (Oxygen has a brief tune, &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, which reenacts the transformation from black-and-white to color that Greenwood describes in her band's cosmology.)</p>\n<p>Oxygen's work would be more substantial sans the clap-along aerobics and art-school posturing, especially since the strongest tracks on <em>All Your Faded Things</em> hinge on actual hooks-- a rarity in a genre often considered to be more consumed by its fashion than its songs. The heartbreaker, &quot;Red Horse Cafe&quot;, offers one of the better backwards glances of this past year, and by dramatically situating the protagonists in the cafe of the song's title to work on a reconciliation, it moves into Johnny Cash Tallyho Tavern territory. Pumped with the storytelling of The Human League or Pulp (think &quot;Disco 2000&quot;), the chorus is smoke-addled, faded scoop-neck sweater, rusted safety-pin pretty. Doubling the vocal tracks, Oxygen heightens and extends her voice, as if resolutely stepping forward for a last dance with arm extended: &quot;I like you so much, I don't want to lose you/ I think I could kiss you but I don't want to hurt you.&quot; Like the best punk, the line mixes desire, a threat, and something to make you want to pogo.</p>\n<p>A few other tracks-- the one-plus-one School House Rock of &quot;Spectacle&quot;, the New Order loveliness of &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, and the spooky choral darkness of &quot;Nerve Angels Three&quot; and &quot;Aviva&quot;-- offer equally solid, if transitory moments. But while Oxygen certainly has a knack for re-inscribing 80s drama into the fabric of 2003, even her best pop is marred by second-rate instrumentation-- lackluster drum tracks, bland keytar lines, and the like. Without taking things further than a flimsy electro zeitgeist, her potentially successful project becomes regrettably tedious.</p>\n",

Except lyrics videos generally don\u2019t include lyrics that aren\u2019t actually in the song. At the end, the Pleasure Masters crew sneaks in a pair of parentheticals: &quot;(The End.) (For Now.)&quot; It makes sense in context, a pulpy twist to match the song\u2019s last line, and at the time a sneaky bit of meta-commentary: Pleasure Masters put the video up just as Annie was trying to free her sophomore album <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13696-dont-stop-all-night-ep/\">Don\u2019t Stop</a></em> from enough <a href=\"http://www.scandipop.co.uk/pleasure-master/\">Island Records red tape</a> to entangle it forever. (She left Island a few months prior and eventually got it released later in 2009.) And four years later, after the <em>Don\u2019t Stop</em> cycle came to its own end (for then), it sounds more appropriate than ever.</p>\n<p><em>A&amp;R</em>, Annie\u2019s comeback EP, stands for Annie and Richard X (and, if you want to stretch the abbreviation, X\u2019s longterm collaborator and onetime vocalist Hannah Robinson): the sole remaining personnel from her <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/456-anniemal/\"><em>Anniemal</em> </a>and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13696-dont-stop-all-night-ep/\"><em>Don\u2019t Stop</em> </a>days. This isn\u2019t necessarily a big aesthetic decision so much as Annie running out of viable ex-collaborators-- <em>Don\u2019t Stop</em>\u2018s Paul Epworth\u2019s subsequent work for a certain British upstart named <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/\">Adele</a> has likely knocked him permanently into a different orbit, one where no matter when you read this he\u2019s probably being asked for another \u201cRolling in the Deep\u201d, and Xenomania lost vogue among British producers around when <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5029-girls-aloud/\">Girls Aloud</a> did. (At least a few post-<em>Don\u2019t Stop</em> Xenomania tracks are somewhere as vaporware, joining her previously announced <em>The Night Within Us!</em> EP.)</p>\n<p>But it <em>sounds</em> like a big aesthetic choice. X and Robinson have been responsible for her best and best-known work-- \u201cChewing Gum\u201d, \u201cSongs Remind Me of You\u201d, \u201cI Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me\u201d-- and more than that, Richard X\u2019s become synonymous during his career with the sort of lush, nostalgic, house-tinged productions that make his core fanbase swoon. Which is the other half of the pun; the five tracks on <em>A&amp;R</em> match Annie to just the sort of repertoire the public\u2019s demanding: danceable, but subtle enough to be positioned as a counterpoint to stadium EDM; nostalgic for the same strains of 90s pop house (X has <a href=\"http://idolator.com/7474230/richard-x-annie-the-ar-ep-interview\">cited</a> Telstar\u2019s <em>Deep Heat</em> compilations as an inspiration) that <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/\">Disclosure</a> and others have taken to the charts. She\u2019s always done that-- <em>Anniemal</em> predicted what\u2019s becoming a decade of slightly skewed blog-pop, and extragenre excursions like \u201cAnthonio\u201d have fit the revivals as well. And while there\u2019s a cynical edge to a lot of this, Annie\u2019s always made it come off like this is just what euphoria happens to sound like to her.</p>\n<p>Or, as one might say, \u201cyou can lose yourself in the sound like it\u2019s yesterday.\u201d That\u2019s the conceit of \u201cBack Together\u201d, as intoxicating a rush of meta-nostalgia as any that\u2019s been set to music. Co-written by Victoria Hesketh of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/26824-little-boots/\">Little Boots</a>, it\u2019s such a dizzy trek through the best parts of <em>Nocturnes</em> that it\u2019s shocking she didn\u2019t keep it for herself. Unlike on the somewhat scattershot <em>Don\u2019t Stop,</em> the collaborators and tangents on <em>A&amp;R</em> blend in seamlessly with the aesthetic: Robinson\u2019s sparkling \u201cHold On\u201d, which is like RAZE\u2019s sampled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPvditqs_U\">Break 4 Love</a>\u201d in a flurry of confectionery sugar, or closer \u201cMixed Emotions,\u201d which works equally well as the crystalline bit of heartbreak on the dance floor that it is or the big-name remix you could assemble from the percussion breakdown and staccato synths underneath.</p>\n<p>All of this could come off overly studied in the wrong hands, but <em>A&amp;R</em> fortunately preserves Annie\u2019s most compelling aspect of all: her wink. \u201cInvisible\u201d, a sneaky grower of a rave-up, introduces another name to the credits: \u201cMannie\u201d, Annie\u2019s pitch-shifted impression of the loutish dude who wouldn\u2019t call. It\u2019s like a battle of the sexes performed by a woman and her club-mirror reflection, and it adds to the track\u2019s po-faced regret something else: levity, frisson, maybe even empowerment. \u201cRalph Macchio\u201d, meanwhile, really is what you suspect it is, which is a chirpy confession of love to the <em>Karate Kid</em> guy whose Google results have a Funny or Die hit in the first three results. (In the chorus: \u201cKiss me once and keep me forever, Ralph Macchio!\u201d Not in the chorus: irony.) It\u2019s by far the goofiest of Annie\u2019s nostalgia plays (<a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2013/07/22/interview-annie/\">her other crush-that-was</a> was Joey McIntyre from New Kids On The Block.) But it <em>works</em>, because the production\u2019s as earnestly ebullient as anything else on the record and because Annie\u2019s a past master at taking goofy subjects and turning them into utterly believable pop: a suitor in a terrible garage-rock band (\u201cI Don\u2019t Like Your Band\u201d), an agony aunt letter about a summer hookup (\u201cAnthonio\u201d again), the sentence \u201cwhat do you want for breakfast?\u201d deployed as a come-on (\u201cThe Breakfast Song\u201d). It\u2019s easy enough to pastiche up a house period piece; 15 people probably just finished one in Ableton. What\u2019s harder to come by is a winning personality.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Annie's second album, <em>Don't Stop</em>, was supposed to come out last year, and for the Norwegian singer's net-savvy audience, it basically did. The version of the record that is being commercially released now is a bit different from what leaked in 2008-- a few tracks have been cut, a few more have been added-- but since it is being released with a bonus disc that includes every notable excluded track save for her cover of Stacey Q's &quot;Two of Hearts&quot;, the final product is less glass-half-empty and more cup-runneth-over. Her final running order for the album proper is certainly an artistic statement worth taking seriously, but we all know that our experience with this music has been and will continue to be a flexible thing, so why should the boundaries of plastic discs matter so much for an artist so closely associated with mp3s?</p>\n<p>Even if CD releases and official track listings are formal considerations that are not entirely significant to Annie's context as a star in a largely theoretical Internet pop universe, it's almost impossible to engage with any version of <em>Don't Stop</em> without thinking about what is &quot;missing.&quot; The most notable omissions from <em>Don't Stop</em> are its top-notch lead single &quot;I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me&quot; and its Italo-disco follow-up &quot;Anthonio&quot;, each\u00a0co-written and produced by Hannah Robinson and Richard X, the duo who previously collaborated with Annie on the excellent\u00a0<em>Anniemal</em> tracks &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; and &quot;Me Plus One&quot;. Though these songs were cut, ostensibly in the interest of keeping the album fresh, it's perplexing to remove such strong material. To make matters worse, the only track from Robinson and X to make it to the official <em>Don't Stop</em> is the clear highlight &quot;Songs Remind Me of You&quot;. This is a strange thing: If Annie has so much proven chemistry with these two writers, why isn't she doing more with them?</p>\n<p>At least part of the answer to that question is that she's been busy working with other producers, namely Girls Aloud masterminds Xenomania, Bloc Party and the Rapture collaborator Paul Epworth, and Timo Kaukolampi, who co-wrote a majority of her debut. Each has a distinct aesthetic, but there is enough balance and common ground in the arrangements that Epworth's sleek electro and Kaukolampi's dense rhythms are complemented rather than overwhelmed by Xenomania's hyperactive hooks. That's not always the case for Annie herself, though. Her demure yet sassy voice is flattered by the production team's efforts on the zippy &quot;My Love Is Better&quot; and the cutesy &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, but she's flattened by &quot;Loco&quot;, a terrific song that is nonetheless so Xenomania-by-numbers that it simply sounds like a Girls Aloud single dropped in the middle of an Annie album. It's not all her fault, though. The Xenomania sound is just so overpowering that you'd never guess that Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand happen to play on the track as well.</p>\n<p>Though the Xenomania cuts are all of good-to-great quality, Paul Epworth's tracks are far more successful in emphasizing Annie's character. &quot;Hey Annie&quot;, a song not present on the original leaked version of <em>Don't Stop</em>, kicks the record off with layered rhythms and spare synthesizer accents that allow her usually wispy voice to be the richest, most alluring element in the arrangement. Whereas the Xenomania crew seem indifferent to her limitations as a vocalist, Epworth is good at finding ways to highlight her best qualities-- the gentle wit, the worldliness in her girlish tone-- while keeping the emphasis placed firmly on grooves. &quot;Hey Annie&quot;, along with Epworth productions &quot;I Don't Like Your Band&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop&quot; are the songs that are most effective as dance music rather than perky Europop. That said, Kaukolampi's &quot;The Breakfast Song&quot; strives for dance floor utility, but unfortunately its blunt, insistent chorus-- &quot;What do you WANT? What do you want for BREAK-FAST?&quot;-- comes out sounding like a maddening jingle for the Scandinavian equivalent of IHOP. His other contributions are respectable but not particularly exciting, though &quot;Take You Home&quot; does provide a dark center for a record generally lacking in melancholy and heavy moods.</p>\n<p>It is standard practice for modern pop records to be assembled in this sort of piecemeal fashion, but Annie's choice of collaborators is very deliberate, both in terms of curatorial taste, and in finding the right artists to achieve the specific end of assembling a dynamic album. Though it is typically the producer and co-writer's job to bring out the best in the star, Annie's best work has a way of encapsulating the appeal of her partners, whether it's showcasing Richard X's gift for giving 1980s pop aesthetics a modern make-over, or Xenomania's glossy, super-charged pop-rock hybrid. Not every song on <em>Don't Stop</em> or its bonus <em>All Night</em> EP is a classic, but Annie's good taste has yielded another fine crop of pop tunes. As with anything else these days, how you listen to this music is entirely up to you, but there is more than enough excellent material here to <a href=\"http://dyfl.tumblr.com/post/212331480/i-cant-let-go\">customize your own version of the record</a>, slip your favorite tracks into a playlist, or you know, listen exactly as Annie intends.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Draw the lines, she says, don't sweat it either. What Annie's made clear with her entry into the <em>DJ-Kicks</em> series is it ain't difficult to see where <em>Anniemal</em> came from or what she's all about. The punk-funk savants ESG (&quot;My Love For You&quot;) anticipate the story behind &quot;The Greatest Hit&quot;, Annie singing over her producer boyfriend's Madonna loop for kicks and ending up with a career in in(die)ternational pop. Adams/Carmichael disco (Bumble Bee Unlimited's &quot;Lady Bug&quot;) nails her high camp chic, while the Mu inclusion (&quot;Paris Hilton&quot;) hints she feels more akin to mutant pop than her vocal similarities to Kylie or Rachel might suggest. And despite her barefaced pop-for-rockers plan for world domination (cf. Braxe and Falke's filter remix of the mini-metal outfit Death From Above 1979's &quot;Black History Month&quot;), Annie doesn't forget she's from the small town of Bergen, Norway, and she generously reps her home on this mix too (electro-pop Toy and fey disco-pop Datarock begin and end the mix respectively). One disc, the influence game is out, so too any doubts re: Annie's big-eared, wide-eyed listening habits.</p>\n<p>Now granted, over the years the mirror has ruined a few. So Annie's own contributions take on increased significance, existing partly just because, partly for the posture of non-posturing, but entirely as proof that her conscious penchant for the off-kilter hasn't strangled her sound. &quot;Wedding&quot; may come off a bit high-low: R\u00f6yksopp's uncharacteristically sinister bubble plop electric production grinds harsh against a song whose chorus is &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; followed by &quot;I do, I do, I do.&quot; But Annie's better than that. Her verb tense fuck-up (should be &quot;I will&quot;) effectively timewarps past fiancehood and flower arrangements and all those stupid fucking pre-Cana meetings, straight to the vow-- funny, if you play along.</p>\n<p>Same thing with the Timo Kaukolampi-produced &quot;Gimme Your Money&quot;, a Cristina-meets-Madonna needy-girl song that tellingly comes between &quot;Lady Bug&quot; (&quot;Just let me be your lady bug&quot;) and Bow Wow Wow's &quot;I Want Candy&quot; (&quot;I want candy&quot;). Annie knows where she fits into these traditions, but even more, she still finds room to install local character. Her vocal contribution to Norwegian producer Brundtland and Therson's debut &quot;Geared Up&quot; tackles that cold, lonely &quot;Poor Leno&quot; pop sound, while Kaukolampi's Motivii Tuntematon's &quot;1939&quot; plays like a Vitalic track at half speed-- perhaps the start of this country's own brand of swisha-&quot;house&quot;.</p>\n<p>Like Kompakt's Michael Mayer said about his Fabric mix, Annie clearly loves her tracks more than the art of loving her tracks. Mixing is merely functional, tracks play long. There is one blatant and unforgivable fuck-up though: Datarock's crosseyed chicken-scratch disco closer &quot;Fa-Fa-Fa&quot; is buried three minutes into the last track because of a cueing error with the Mu track before, which will disorient people not familiar with the songs.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the mistake feeds into the mix's biggest appeal, its amateurism. Annie's has more of a friend-to-friend feel than any other <em>Kicks</em> entry, the kind of mix with messages to be decoded, biography to be considered. Can't say the same for most DJ mixes, really, and definitely not for artist full-lengths. Whether in character or inadvertently, Annie invites weirdly personal reactions, as anyone she's pointed at in concert can tell you. <em>Anniemal</em> was the first date, and now she's making us mixes. Oh, she wants to be my lady bug-- well that's just great.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Depending on whom you ask-- and even in which country you live-- &quot;pop&quot; can mean a lot of different things. It's a word that's been demonized and marginalized, especially amongst stodgy and often conservative U.S. rock critics. Values, and the means in which they're defined, have been frequent talking points in the past couple of weeks, both in the rockcrit world (thanks to Kelefa Sanneh's recent <em>New York Times</em> Arts cover story on rockism) and in the nation at large (oh, you know). In each case, the conservative factions have framed their dialogue in pretty knee-jerk terms. Most rock critics' views of unity, it would seem, aren't dissimilar to George W.'s-- in the best Christian tradition, it's achieved through converting the heathens and savages. Just as our family values are apparently now defined by bigotry, fear, and ignorance, so too is &quot;phony,&quot; &quot;plastic,&quot; &quot;inauthentic&quot; pop music.</p>\n<p>Well, fuck all that: Just as (to borrow Biblical terms) ideas like love, hope, brotherhood, and charity should be central to American values, pop is music's culture of life. It's a celebration of togetherness, the sound of universal pursuits and needs such as truth and beauty; of seeking a sense of self and, when desirable, giving yourself over to the crowd; of wanting to dance, smile, laugh, love, and be loved-- and it undiscriminatingly expresses it all to loads of people in a few short minutes. <em>Before Sunset</em>'s Jesse may have been talking out of his ass when he said his next novel was going to take place within the span of a single pop song, but there's something lovely about the idea. And anyway, maybe it's not so far-fetched to live a large portion of your life in a single song: Anne Lilia Berge-Strand has done it-- though not out of choice.</p>\n<p>Ms. Berge-Strand (Annie to her friends and the record-buying public) believed that her debut record would have been released years ago, but fate intervened when her musical and romantic partner, Tore Korknes (Erot), died in 2001 from heart complications at the age of 23. The pair had only recorded one track, 1999's vaguely dubby electro-house love song &quot;The Greatest Hit&quot;, an intoxicating clubland &quot;duet&quot; between producer and vocalist. The single-- along with Erot's solo work and that of fellow Nords R\u00f6yksopp-- helped launch Tell\u00e9 Records and, thankfully, is included here alongside another dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals.</p>\n<p>Whether due to Annie's backstory or not, there's a palpable sense of melancholy permeating this album. She's at her most confident while dispensing romantic advice to herself on the playful, wobbly Richard X collaboration &quot;Chewing Gum&quot;, but on &quot;No Easy Love&quot;, as she struggles to maintain hope in a search for love and grapples with the netless tightrope of commitment, Annie's voice barely rises above a whisper.</p>\n<p>In addition to Erot and Richard X (who also co-wrote the winking, seductive &quot;Me Plus One&quot;), <em>Anniemal</em> features a trio of tracks produced by R\u00f6yksopp's Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland, and a handful created with Op:l Bastards' Timo Kaukolampi. This all-star team of Northern European electro-house producers infuses the record with often low, rumbling bass, twitchy synths, and an oddly high-altitude light-headedness-- like floating, high on oxygen, just above a dancefloor. &quot;Always Too Late&quot; lurches like a cross between Missy Elliott and UK garage and &quot;Come Together&quot; is pure acid house retro, but most of the sonics shade closely to each producer's already signature sounds.</p>\n<p>For her part, Annie will likely draw comparisons to Kylie Minogue and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell. Such talk is most likely a slap at each artist's relatively thin vocals but, like the other two (especially Cracknell), Annie coaxes quite a bit from her cellophane pipes and transforms her weakness into strength. Annie's vocals can't help but hide the senses of sorrow and vulnerability that run through her songs, and that makes her urge to get herself back up off the wall and reclaim her once-shattered life all the more touching. And unlike Kylie, who exists in a celebrity neverworld, or Cracknell, who manages to make familiar settings seem like the most glamorous places in the world, Annie's tracks navigate the typical urban worlds of bars, cars, clubs, flats, and high streets. She dreams of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and gives herself romantic advice in the mirror, yet her world should be pretty familiar to much of her audience-- sometimes achingly so.</p>\n<p>It all peaks with &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, one of the tracks Annie recorded with Brundtland. Last month, Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester said he thought it was the best song of the year, and I agree. On one listen, it doesn't sound like the best song of the year: It doesn't do the things that year-defining tracks are supposed to do-- break new sonic ground or spearhead a trend or paradigm shift. No, what it does better than anything this year is what great pop often does: It articulates our most basic desires in an almost irresistibly catchy package.</p>\n<p>The track itself narrates a party, drinks with friends, and the thrill of a first encounter-- all that many people want from a night out. It communicates a love for music, friendship, and connection, and celebrates the moments when all three merge perfectly. The track's rhythm is obviously supposed to mirror the song's title, and that could have been cloying or heavy-handed, but when that rhythm quickens and doubles its pace as Annie catches the eye of and moves to the beat with another partygoer, it becomes a deceptively simple and surprisingly beautiful articulation of basic human need, beautifully encapsulating every element of human excitement-- guilt, nerves, excitement, hope. The culture of life.</p>\n",

A word that Babelfish and online translation engines fail to process. Brel, unable to better describe his hometown, simply uttered, &quot;When Brussels was Brussels, when Brussels... brusseled.&quot; Camden hipsters may be more familiar with Belgo, the Chalk Farm eatery where servers in monks' habits serve mussels, frites, and trappist ale in a cold, aluminum, industrial loft, than the Belgian stepsister of Factory Records, Factory Benelux, and its Brussels-based sister label Les Disques du Crepuscule. Though the label served as a continental dumping ground for the tour-support one-offs of major players-- like A Certain Ratio's inaugural &quot;Shack Up&quot; seven-inch, and later, New Order's &quot;Touched by the Hand of God&quot; and &quot;Everything's Gone Green&quot; singles-- it cultivated its own indigenous roster with groups like The Names, Minny Pops, and the massively overlooked Antena.</p>\n<p>The Names waded in slowed Peter Hook bassline facsimiles and faux-Morrissey moaning on their <em>Swimming</em> LP. Minny Pops ventured into colder electro-Teutonic territory. Antena, however, macheted into theretofore (and heretofore) unexplored territory for post-punk-- namely the oddball psychedelic scene of South America. Recorded with echoing minimalism, Antena's major release, <em>Camino del Sol</em>, evokes dreaming, singing, charmingly off-the-mark sci-fi futurism, and the black-and-white nostalgia of Brel's Brussels. It's as beautifully outdated, yet strikingly mind-boggling and timeless, as the towering Atomium over the Expo '58 grounds.</p>\n<p>The newly formed vinyl junkie reissue label, Numero, sniffed this truffle, and has released it between more traditional reissues of a rare soul compilation and a power-pop box set. <em>Camino del Sol</em> was originally a five-song twelve-inch from 1980, but was later expanded to a full-length by Crepuscule in 1982 with added singles. This reissue further expands the release with the &quot;Seaside Weekend&quot; single, two unreleased tracks (&quot;Frantz&quot; and &quot;Ingenuous&quot;), and new artwork. With any justice, it will bring new light to a lost gem, as similar reissues did for Os Mutantes, whose adolescent dementia influences this record's tropicalia songs (&quot;The Boy from Ipanema&quot;, &quot;Sissexa&quot;), and Shuggie Otis, whose piquantly primitive drum machines propel each track. So much hidden influence lies in these songs. The wonderful opening punch of &quot;To Climb the Cliff&quot; and the title track predate Stereolab's Gainsbourg-gone-Kraftwerk by over a decade, and Air's cool, Parisian sex by nearly two. Tortoise directly lifted the syncopated synthetic funk of &quot;To Climb the Cliff&quot; on their equally rare seven-inch, &quot;Madison Ave/Madison Area&quot;.</p>\n<p>Stuttering kick drums, icicle synths, and robotic bass jerks the listener through &quot;Spiral Staircase&quot; with better effect than a handful of contemporary NY revivalists. Limited to the use of the above ingredients and the occasional dry electric guitar, Antena relied on vast amounts of space for haunting texture. Each member sounds isolated in far corners of an airport hangar, allowing coke-bottle percussion, sound effects, and Isabelle Antena's detached, seductive voice to float. The more propulsive tracks are offset by opiated cocktail numbers like &quot;Silly Things&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Papaye&quot;, and &quot;Noelle A Hawaii&quot;. Yet, the faint echo of Antena's label cousins Joy Division keeps things perversely intoxicating. Only on &quot;Les Demoiselles de Rochefort&quot;, a cover of Michel Legrand's theme to the Catherine Deneuve film, do Antena sound positively retro-minded. Even then, the strings and horns seemingly waft from a wormhole.</p>\n<p>The band fell apart soon after this release, and carried on into goofy plastic jazz before Isabella turned it all into a solo vehicle. These days, Isabelle Antena still rides the stereotypical &quot;Big in Japan&quot; wave, touring the country and releasing smooth adult albums in some cruel approximation of <em>Lost in Translation</em>'s Sausalito. Yet she'll always have this document of inspired originality in her past, which, with this reissue, could very well make her a rediscovered figure. As this album proves, she was much more akin to Beck and Bj\u00f6rk than her dour trend-following contemporaries. So unique perhaps only Jacques Brel found the verb for it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Anthony &quot;Shake&quot; Shakir is a longtime techno producer from Detroit. His first track, &quot;Sequence 10&quot;, was featured on Virgin's seminal <em>Techno: The New Dance Sound of Detroit</em> in 1988. You can draw short, uninterrupted lines between Shakir and any of the first-\u00a0(Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May) or second-wave (Underground Resistance, Carl Craig) Detroit techno acts. Yet his hometown, chosen genre, and general demeanor-- much of Shakir's work has come out on his own Frictional label; he refused to promote his work in European markets, although they embraced many of his contemporaries-- have boxed Shakir into obscurity. <em>Frictionalism 1994-2009</em>, a 3xCD, 35-track retrospective on Rush Hour Recordings (an abbreviated, 4x12&quot; vinyl set of the same name appeared late last year), places many of Shakir's records on CD for the first time and sheds light on one of Detroit techno's great, unclaimed dance artists.</p>\n<p>At his best, Shakir is a hypnotic producer, spools of psychedelic noise whipping off his tightly coiled beats. A noted pop fan-- he's notoriously unafraid of playing pop music in his DJ sets, and he once sampled the B-52's-- the tracks on <em>Frictionalism</em> rarely betray their samples, yet they also avoid slipping into noise or ambience. Tracks could function on the floor, but they don't always feel as if they were constructed for that purpose.\u00a0This is fitting. In interviews Shakir comes off as an introspective ball of contradictions; it is difficult to imagine him attending many club nights. Within a group of musicians already notoriously peeved about a lack of respect, Shakir seems particularly upset, referring to himself as the &quot;invisible man of techno.&quot; But Shakir is also self-deprecating and aware: He frequently referred to himself as the janitor of Juan Atkins' Metroplex Records; he now admits that much of his invisibility is his own doing.</p>\n<p><em>Frictionalism</em> is spry and elegant throughout, notable from a scene whose progenitors were both establishing a new genre and learning to use their instruments. &quot;Stereotype&quot;'s slowly gathering strings and &quot;Arise&quot;'s alien synthesizers sound deluxe and deeply musical. &quot;Roaming&quot; contains a bobbing jazz bassline; &quot;Simpatico&quot; is a keyboard-helmed house jam that is modest and self-contained. <em>Frictionalism</em> spreads out over three and a half hours but it contains few anthems and fewer indulgences, Shakir preferring instead to provide to just lay in the grooves of his regenerating hop.</p>\n<p>Shakir is known for incorporating hip-hop into his productions, and while the vast majority of <em>Frictionalism</em> exists on the techno axis, it'd be easy to see J Dilla latch onto the symphonic jazz of &quot;Detroit State of Mind&quot; or Madlib onto the smoky Eastern funk of the spectacularly titled &quot;Things Come and Go&quot;.\u00a0Influence is a strange concept with an artist like Shakir, though. He produced formative work during a formative period, but his records have long been out of print, and ascribing any real guidance to his work requires a lot of faith in the record collections of his offspring. Did Kieran Hebden ever run across the Four Tet-y &quot;Tracks for My Father&quot; 12&quot;? Does it matter if he didn't?</p>\n<p>Shakir is at a crossroads. Earlier this decade he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis; he attributed a years-long recording layoff to purchasing the wrong recording software for his laptop. But last year's <em>Levitate Venice</em> EP was received with reverence and acclaim; <em>Frictionalism</em> makes his work available in a way it has never been (Shakir chose Rush Hour specifically for their European distribution capabilities). Shakir fondly compares techno producers with jazz musicians for their ability to extend their creative lives. <em>Frictionalism</em> gives him the opportunity to continue in front of an audience, but it also exposes an already rewarding creative life that deserves more company.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>To call <em>Body Pill</em> Anthony Naples' debut album should probably come with a big fat caveat: its eight tracks only amount to 29 minutes' total running time, and two of its cuts are just a sketch-like two minutes long. But who cares when the record holds together this well? It <em>feels</em> like an album, which, in the post-format day and age, is the only guideline that matters. And it certainly doesn't feel like a debut\u2014at least, not in the sense of baby steps or half-measures. The New York electronic musician's vision is fully formed here, and it's original enough for him to stand out from the scads of producers trying similar hybrids of house, techno, and beat-up home-listening fare.</p>\n<p>That confidence is all the more striking given that Naples is a relative newcomer. He put out his first record in 2012, on <a href=\"http://mistersaturdaynight.com/\">Mister Saturday Night</a>, the label arm of a popular New York party series. Strikingly, &quot;Mad Disrespect&quot; was the first song he had ever completed\u2014not bad at all, given how effortlessly it flitted between the cut-up soul of artists like Andr\u00e9s and the slightly off-kilter vibe of artists like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/\">Four Tet</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/\">Caribou</a> in dancefloor mode. Since then, he's recorded a handful of singles and EPs that have built upon the foundation established by his debut. They've all tended towards snapping house rhythms marked by flayed hi-hats and nervous, syncopated kick drums; he's fond of chopped-up keys and copious overdrive. Equal parts sweet and gruff, his club tracks are typically as juicy as a bruised blood orange.</p>\n<p>But <em>Body Pill</em>, despite the title, swerves away from the club. Its opening track, &quot;Ris&quot;, opens with two minutes of beatless drones, and the drums-and-synth figure that rises up out of the fog sounds less like dance music than a Casiotone reconstruction of the opening bars of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/\">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvDuATZCY8I\">&quot;Teen Age Riot&quot;</a>. &quot;Abrazo&quot;, which follows, is a proper club track (even if that 3:25 running time may send DJs scrambling to come up with a follow-up before it fades out); its keening string loops and keyboard counterpoints are clearly in the vein of P\u00e9p\u00e9 Bradock or Andr\u00e9s, and it employs some of the toughest, most declarative drums on the whole record. Still, it doesn't take long to see that Naples' idea of dance music is a little bit different from the norm. The drums are sort of lumpy and disheveled; the hi-hat is turned up a hair too loud, and the snare sticks out like a broken front tooth. All that roughness is a way of balancing out the melancholy strings, but it also highlights the way even the strings are a little bit raw, their fidelity rough and their waveform crudely truncated; if this were a visual collage, there'd be Scotch tape visible over the corners of the picture.</p>\n<p>The closing track, &quot;Miles&quot;, seems like it'll be another of the record's go-to dancefloor cuts, given its overlapping layers of drum machine and sampled percussion and its eyes-closed deep house vibes; it rings like a lawn sprinkler aimed at a gamelan ensemble. But then a curious thing happens: shortly before the three-minute marker, it fades out, the tempo shifts from 120 to 110 beats per minute, and we're ushered out with tapped hi-hats and a tentative, burbling melody, as though someone had stepped on the hose. The rest of the album proceeds along similar lines, in which club-music convention is tweaked ever so slightly, its tropes repurposed for squirrelier aims. &quot;Changes&quot; balances absent-minded keys\u2014a tinkly little up-and-down melody, an unbroken chord\u2014with a cutting machine beat that spins idly in place, throwing off sparks. It's tough and drowsy all at once, and so is &quot;Refugio&quot;, its tarnished counterpoints sounding like a conversation between two lonely robots. Most producers tend to visualize packed dancefloors when they're writing music, but I suspect this one was made with an empty room in mind, given the way its melody scoots like an idle gobo pattern across buffed hardwood. The only club-oriented track here that doesn't work so well is &quot;Used to Be&quot;, which swathes swaggering, dubstep-inspired bass and drums in rosy <em>Twin Peaks</em> chords. It's not bad, but it feels aimless\u2014even though, ironically, it's one of the record's most clearly defined tracks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he's simply better at abstraction. The drum-free, two-minute &quot;Pale&quot; sounds even more like a '70s public-television soundtrack cue than <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/\">Boards of Canada</a>'s music does; &quot;Way Stone&quot;, with its tight ripples of delay, might be sourced from rocks skipped across a still lake. Its wooden lead sounds like a kalimba wrapped in layers of sticky masking tape; at the short track's end, there's a rush of white noise like a seashell being held up to the ear. It's not terribly hard to make music that signifies varying shades of melancholy or unease; &quot;moody&quot; seems to be the default setting in dance music these days, from the underground to the main stage. But <em>Body Pill</em> is different: it's moody, but in a way that feels like he's not entirely clear about what the underlying mood really is. And there's an honesty to that. It sounds less like a young producer enjoying the fruits of quick success than a restless experimenter figuring out what to do next. Lucky for us, the woodshed is destination enough.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Even with the 10th anniversary of their debut album around the corner, it seems silly to ponder Anti-Pop Consortium's place in hip hop. Name, sound, rhyme style, lyrical content, release sleeve iconography: Anti-Pop were stylized (by the press as much as by themselves) as a fuck-you, a caustic riposte to a genre that had apparently taken every wrong turn possible in the 1990s. They likely give as much of a shit about how they &quot;fit in&quot; with rap in 2009 as they do about concepts like &quot;limited appeal.&quot;</p>\n<p>Which is not to say the group doesn't have enough history behind them to be assessed on their own terms. They've gone from straight-up alienating to a somewhat reconciliatory place within the hip-hop nation. For an act usually classed with the late-90s mini-boom in indie-rap futurism, Anti-Pop's earliest 12&quot;s sounded as if they were made with equipment as old as the printing press. A move to Warp for 2002's <em>Arrythmia</em> added a fresh coat of accessibility to Anti-Pop's antagonistic minimalism.</p>\n<p><em>Fluorescent Black--</em> their first non-collaborative album in seven years--\u00a0sounds like Anti-Pop spent their time away coming to grips with the implied-but-never-fully-embraced pleasure principle of <em>Arrythmia</em> via side projects and solo albums. The foursome's name only occasionally suits the music here, unless you take branding into consideration. <em>Fluorescent Black</em> won't blow up at a time when Rick Ross deigning to sound interested on his own album is considered a major step forward among hip-hop critics, but here Anti-Pop take a less partisan approach to fun.</p>\n<p>And so since we're talking party music: &quot;NY to Tokyo&quot;-- which sounds\u00a0stitched from 21st-century De La Soul and Men At Work's melody library--\u00a0is <em>chipper</em>, about the last adjective I ever expected to use to describe an Anti-Pop record. And while Beans remains the Anti-Pop member you could best sell to rap fans who consider it music rather than some outlaw adjunct to poetry, even M. Sayyid and High Priest sound loosened up across the album, slowing down, using crowd-pleasing pacing, more willing to meet an audience raised on &quot;Crank Dat&quot;-grade rhymes halfway.</p>\n<p>&quot;Goofy&quot;: there's another word you'd be more likely to slap on Soulja Boy than Anti-Pop. Ditto &quot;playful.&quot; And yet here's &quot;Born Electric&quot;, with a hammy piano intro and ludicrously straight-faced crooning, managing to evoke Journey, Derrick May, and Vanessa Carlton within its first minute. I'm not even sure if Mike Ladd at his most Infections/Majesticons promiscuous would put Detroit pads and AOR cheese-pomp in the same track, let alone as its appetizer. <em>Fluorescent Black</em>'s backing tracks, in all their mutant techno overbrightness and zig-zagging detail, re-expand the indie hip-hop palette. Not always to the good, mind you. Is &quot;The Solution&quot; a Kanye/T-Pain robo-voice tribute or parody? Or just a lukewarm trend jack? So sometimes they may be winking too hard to sell certain songs as anything other than well-made gags-- Anti-Pop's button-pushing still makes a nice break from all the posthumous J Dilla fellatio going around.</p>\n<p>All this lightening up is probably good for the soul, but what of the Anti-Pop refuseniks first fell in love with? Sometimes it crops up in unexpected ways. I appreciate anyone with the balls to scatter fans and foes alike with an album-opening blast of fugly hair metal. But my favorite track here might be the shortest and most &quot;traditionally Anti-Pop.&quot; Lasting 1:30, its foul synth lurch like real-deal Rotterdam rottenness, Beans rips through &quot;Dragunov&quot; without pause, hook for cover, or cop to, well, pop. Music stripped to blunt-rhythm-and-nothing-but, the rap an excuse to leave fans breathless over skills they don't possess, &quot;Dragunov&quot; is hip-hop as old west line-in-sand at high noon, half-steppers left outside to wonder what the fuss is about.</p>\n<p>These go-hard-or-go-home tracks are still sprinkled across <em>Fluorescent Black</em>-- dizzying first single &quot;Capricorn One&quot;; &quot;End Game&quot;, a near-arrhythmic duel between gunshot-terse rhyme fragments and the beatbox it sounds like they're slowly killing; &quot;Timpani&quot;'s (yes, them again) Neubauten tribalism and pervy Martin Denny jungle howls. But those who've been along for the 10-plus year ride may be looking for more of them. No one could stay as intractable as early Anti-Pop forever-- who would want to, except maybe straight-up horse-corpse-beating nihilists?-- but this sort of delight in scrapping is still what APC do best. The idea of an Anti-Pop greatest hits may be anathema-- at least philosophically-- but the moments when they push the genre's boundaries, rather than just fan expectations, are the parts of the group's catalog that will endure.</p>\n",

Yes, he's the greatest pianist of the modern age, blending diverse atonal qualities with an unequivocal spryness and an effortless range of emotion, and all those other things that come with being a brilliant player. (Free cocktails?) But when you compare the sentiment in a record like <em>Nu Bop</em> to that of most 20th Century composers with a similar vision, Shipp's stuff just doesn't hang on the low end of the friction enough. I want his music to punch me in the face with its dramatic, chaotic authority. He is for the advancement of jazz. He is supposed to be the Edgard Var\u00e8se, the Charles Ives of our generation, goddammit, interpreting the city sounds around him through improvisation and a sensitive, reflective ear. Unfortunately, the purpose of his recordings-- evolving jazz by including its urban peers in hip-hop and electronics-- has always stopped a hair short of success. The performances are airtight, but the crust is soft.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, one thing that was missing was Antipop Consortium, and more specifically, their unequalled, futuristic, split-atom beats. Up 'til now, Shipp's beat programmers have been all wrong. Past collaborators DJ Spooky and FLAM are decent from an electronic and an emotional standpoint, but what they've offered hasn't ever defied expectations. If Shipp truly wants to advance jazz into the realm of youth-popular urban culture, he's gotta break bread with the crazy funk, collaborate with the most innovative musicians.</p>\n<p><em>Antipop vs. Matthew Shipp</em> opens with a brow-furrowed block of Shipp's piano chords cut into the boom-bap of the bass and hi-hat. It's an imposing, rhythm-heavy intro, and while not a complete song, its neon spritzes of keyboards and backwards-looped cymbals offer a clear theme of what's to come: future jazz in the most definitive sense. From there, Shipp's piano turns backflips all over APC's swimmy, electro-alarms. William Parker's bass and Shipp's low-end counter each other as Beans and Priest holler, &quot;Stereo! Stereo, Stereo! It sounds so fresh, I'll sing it once and repeat!&quot;. From here, the mix alternates between rap solos, piano solos, some loose drums, chunks of chords, sample of dogs barking (two breeds), keyboards on the holodeck. Shipp's piano is sampled for melody and rhythm, as much as it solos-- and even the high-end, winky optimism with which Shipp sometimes flirts holds up way deffer as a platform with a little electro street beat.</p>\n<p>There's not much of that froufy shit, though; it wouldn't be an Antipop joint without their cold, twitchy vision: &quot;Svp&quot;, &quot;Stream Light&quot; and &quot;Coda&quot;, specifically, feature their marble-clinking rhythms and bleak, controlled atmosphere, M. Sayyid rapping with a resigned wateriness in his voice, and blooming with heavy-footed atonal melodies. &quot;Monstro City&quot; has a cigarette-burning be-bop vibe, lyrics unfurled like spoken word in tandem with clicky bongo and, yes, more gaping hunks of piano chords, teetering into a dark chasm of a future. This is true-blue street jazz, and you can tell it comes straight from the heart and head.</p>\n<p>Okay, but the thing is, this is billed as an Antipop Consortium record-- their absolute last release, as a matter of fact, since they broke up last autumn. (R.I.P!!!) And while this is a step forward for Shipp, for APC, it's a side-step from their gleamingly tricked-out, beat-tweaked and freaky <em>Arrhythmia</em>. <em>Antipop vs. Matthew Shipp</em> is solid, yes, but the experimentation doesn't always work in their favor, and it often dilutes the propulsive fire beneath their final release. Then again, maybe it's appropriate that their last hurrah-- Antipop's final track, &quot;Free Hop&quot;, has them melting scratches and turntables backwards over a charged improv session, marking a deflated and untimely end, for eight years was simply not enough.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Have you ever felt your heart race or skip a beat? Well, if you weren't dropping X or having a heart attack, chances are what you felt was an arrhythmia-- an irregularity in the rhythm of your heartbeat. Like the title suggests, the Anti-Pop Consortium knows a thing or two about irregular beats. Their latest LP,<em>Arrhythmia</em>, is a study in them, as well as just about everything else irregular, save perhaps my recent string of emergency bowel movements.</p>\n<p>Anti-Pop Consortium is the charter member of Warp Records' hip-hop club. This should tell you something. In case you haven't been keeping up, Warp has gained worldwide accolades for its roster of IDM trailblazers: Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin, to name only a few. And in case you were wondering, no, APC doesn't sound a hell of a lot like Ludacris. Once someone finally does the hard work of labeling hip-hop's various subgenres, Anti-Pop just might carve out a region known as &quot;free hip-hop,&quot; not unlike the free jazz of Sun Ra who the boys cite as a major influence. Their sound is unique, drawing a happy experimental medium somewhere between the ghetto and the laptop (or maybe even the rave), with cerebral lyrics straight from the poetry cafe.</p>\n<p>To begin with, APC employs a variety of unusual samples: VH-1 <em>Pop-Up Video</em> bubbles, robotic video game bleeps, jingle bells, midsummer's cricket chirps, finger snaps, and the most inventive, an entire song built around the bounce of a ping pong ball (&quot;Ping Pong [The Return]&quot;). Behind the samples are built-from-scratch drum-n-bass beats-- largely sterile and inorganic, favoring programming over sampling dusty vinyl. The results are progressive, glitchy, angular and off-kilter. Again, not Ludacris.</p>\n<p>Anti-Pop are similarly unconventional in their lyrics, albeit more in their content than in how they flow. So you get a whole track about an unfortunate old soul bent on eliminating soap scum (&quot;We Kill Soap Scum&quot;), and another telling a tale of wisely avoiding crack-ho jailbait (&quot;Minna Street&quot;). The lyrics sound calculated, considered, sometimes profound, and always heady. For all who've heard MCs wax philosophical and come off pretentious, you'll be happy to hear that APC goes the same route, without the turgid results.</p>\n<p>Highlights include the first proper track, &quot;Bubbles.&quot; which tends towards more traditional hip-hop, utilizing a P-Funk-style synth-bass hook over congas and hand claps. &quot;Ghost Lawns&quot; draws from the &quot;B.O.B.&quot; school of beats, a seriously uptempo drum-n-bass number with accordingly frenetic rhymes, and the let's-get-ready chants of &quot;tonight, alright&quot; by a chorus of young ladies in between verses.</p>\n<p>Pushing hip-hop's creative boundaries has its pitfalls, however. On <em>Arrhythmia</em>, where progressive equals electronic, the beats occasionally come off as a tad thin. Strange to say, but they just lack soul. This is the only real weakness, but it's a significant one; even though every track is good, none push that adjective past a &quot;very&quot; prefix. Perhaps rumpshaking is too much to ask for, but one might like something nasty, or funky, or fierce. Yet despite its shortcomings, <em>Arrhythmia</em> has plenty of appeal, particularly to the indie crowd, for whom progressivism is a badge of pride. And after all, it is the Consortium's best release yet. Just don't expect to see these three on the cover of <em>Source</em> anytime soon.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Ex-<em>Pitchfork</em> writer James Wisdom done a bad deed with his review of Anti-Pop Consortium's first album. <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> a 6.5? It's not some underground classic, but their mix of sharp rhythms and relentless rhymes made for a tight debut, even if it left a cold, chemical aftertaste. I'm not coming all &quot;saviors of hip-hop&quot;-- Wisdom had a point: too many loops made for monotonous grooves, and their dense wordflow tried too hard to intimidate. Overly bleak maybe, but not surprising; hell, Anti-Popper Beans even cites Bauhaus and Section 25 as influences. But along with Mike Ladd's Parliament-ary <em>Afterfuture</em> and the Infesticons' <em>Gun Hill Road</em>, <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> was one of those mindtrip albums of 2000 that could send you to a heaven at least somewhere in the 7.0s.</p>\n<p>So hopefully we can give props to the Consortium while avoiding some internecine staffer warfare. Anti-Pop's on Warp now, and for a second you might think the label's looking to duplicate the success of Cannibal Ox. &quot;Tuff Gong&quot; fires off rattling tin can percussion and a raw, bombastic bassline reminiscent of everything on <em>The Cold Vein</em>. M. Sayyid spits some typical insults at first, but then the song cuts to this organic double-bass skronk and he doubletimes, tongue almost audibly flapping. He balances precariously, nearly losing it, but ends on point with, &quot;You pulled out a nine/ I turned into a green light and ran over your mind.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Tuff Gong&quot; is clearly an intro track, and &quot;Splinter&quot; follows seamlessly with some duke-duke-duke of earl-style vocals and a nice, understated keyboard melody. Beans' warm voice begins, &quot;Fillin' em with penicillin and Benadryl/ Drillin' a fillin' and spillin' my feelings.&quot; His delivery's always smooth but I'm struck by the excitement-- nobody's detached like the last joint. Likewise, M. Sayyid snarls eagerly, &quot;I got crowds movin' like U.N. flags.&quot; Somebody's got to fall off though, and here, it's High Priest. You can pinpoint right when his freestyle degenerates into a bastardized Kool-Keith grocery-list recitation, the kind of flat flow that heads always hate in &quot;progressive&quot; hip-hop.</p>\n<p>But Priest redeems-- regular Anti-Pop producer Earl Blaize steps back to the engineer role for this EP, and each of the three MCs get a chance to shine on their own tracks. Priest proves the skills that got him on Mille Plateaux's click-hop comps. He crafts &quot;39303&quot; from random beeps and babbling samples, mixing it all together suddenly as Beans launches into an abstract monologue. It cuts off too quickly, probably the only problem with this EP: most tracks just seem sketches. But Priest's next piece, &quot;Pit,&quot; distracts attention once again with an instrumental full of divebombing pitchshifts that squeak like Kraftwerkian birds of paradise. Beans' &quot;Dystopian Disco Force&quot; and M. Sayyid's &quot;Perpendicular&quot; go the more mainstream route. The latter develops into a DJ Muggs-style trip-hop ditty, and the former is straight-up funk, organ runs and wah-wah guitars included.</p>\n<p>Were there any instrumentals at all on <em>Tragic Epilogue</em>? Must have slept through them, if so. But this EP just constantly keeps your head bobbing. They've extended the challenges of vocal freestyle to the music, and the improvised weirdness avoids the dull loops <em>Epilogue</em> fell into. &quot;Vector&quot; ends with another vocal track and the upbeat meter is perfect (likewise the buoyant, humming Moog). The Consortium seems to have learned that Anti-Pop doesn't equal mind-numbing, machine-like music. I'm just hoping the experimental tip transfers to their new album in 2002. <em>The Ends Against the Middle</em> is only a 17-minute EP, but unlike their fast-forward-guy logo, when this finishes, I'm ready to rewind.</p>\n",

After having in rotation about 20 discs of varying genres for about two months, I reach the final offering: <em>Tragic Epilogue</em>. When writing reviews, you soon see that the best discs and worst discs make themselves evident early on, begging immediate attention. It's the unspectacular discs that linger. Thus, we come to Anti Pop Consortium.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I'm spoiled. <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> will surely remind you of Kool Keith's cock-rocking rhymes ensconced in twisted samples and off-kilter beats, but without many of the things that make his style so effective. Where Keith's rhymes veer from the preposterous to the ridiculous and back again, Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesters Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wallow in enervating obscurity that, while sometimes fresh and dead-on, is too often flat and unworthy of interest. Where Keith's verbose wordplay winks sarcastically, Anti-Pop is disappointingly earnest, as if by taking themselves seriously, we will, too. No.</p>\n<p>Generally minimal, preferring repeating loops over cut-n-splice, much of <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> is occupied by one rapper rhyming over a loop that cycles repeatedly, giving many tracks an unpleasant endless feel. This sense transfers to the album as a whole with few sonic mileposts to signify what track-- or even what half of the album-- you're hearing. Most of the juiciest soundbytes are laid down at track openings, only to vanish and not be revisited.</p>\n<p>Yet, <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> is clearly fresh by overall rap standards. There are few rappers around these days that could even compare to Kool Keith, and that's to Anti-Pop's credit. The track transitions and a few of the beats are interesting, pulling together a combination of clich\u00e9d 4/4 rap beats and edgy Autechre-inspired electronic mutations. It's a hopeful combination, but my sense is that Anti-Pop Consortium is clinging to the tired rap paradigm of rhyme and simple beat. They take small risks that beg bigger ones, and finally disappoint when the goods aren't delivered.</p>\n<p><em>Tragic Epilogue</em> is riddled with a feeling of unrealized potential that doesn't quite go the distance. It's an auspicious debut, but one that's more likely to draw your attention to the band's future than to send you scattering for spare change to pick it up.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29521-apache-dropout/\">Apache Dropout</a> are drenched in retro signifiers. They took their name from a song by 1970s Brit group <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Broughton_Band\">the Edgar Broughton Band</a> and <a href=\"http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/track/1-2-3-red-light\">covered</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1910_Fruitgum_Company\">1910 Fruitgum Company</a>, their album <a href=\"http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/music\">art</a> resembles classic poster styles, and their music bleeds history with its fuzzy garage riffs, cardboard-box beats, crackly movie-dialogue samples, and the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/\">Roky Erickson</a>-worthy yelps of rubber-voiced singer Sonny Blood. It\u2019s almost too perfect that the Indiana trio called their last album <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16893-bubblegum-graveyard/\">Bubblegum Graveyard</a></em> and adorned it with a <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Crypt_(comics)\">Tales From the Crypt</a></em>-style zombie cartoon\u2013their music often sounds like '60s DIY pop rising from its own ashes.</p>\n<p>Yet unlike a lot of retro-styled groups, there\u2019s not much nostalgia going in Apache Dropout\u2019s music. Their simple tunes and the earnest way they bash them out suggest they see the past not as an escape, but a source of fuel. They tap into the gut-level immediacy of garage rock in order to make their music sound present. In this way, they share a sensibility with the many retro-tinted groups <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6140-ian-svenonius/\">Ian Svenonius</a> has fronted, but without his sly commentary. Where<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2653-make-up/\">\u00a0Make-Up</a> or <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/27822-chain-and-the-gang/\">Chain and the Gang</a> are often winking, Apache Dropout stare straight ahead.</p>\n<p>Immediacy is the most distinguishing characteristic of their third album, <em>Heavy Window</em>. Their 2011 self-titled <a href=\"http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/album/apache-dropout\">debut</a> was a bit more primitive, and *Bubblegum Graveyard *perhaps had sharper songs\u2014but Apache Dropout has never sounded as fiery as they do in these 11 tracks spread across a hectic 34 minutes. They open with Blood's trademark screech, and from then on rarely stop to breathe, chugging and churning through every three-chord cycle and one-two stomp like they have a curfew. The speed varies, but the urgency is constant, and the sound is more combustible now too: Blood\u2019s sandpaper guitar and Anu Nath's fur-lined bass rub together like kindling, shooting off sparks at every turn.</p>\n<p>That combination lights up so often that it threatens to immolate the album; \u201cTired Old Story\u201d actually descends into pure fuzz, burying drums and vocals beneath a wall of flame. But Apache Dropout follow that with their snappiest tune, \u201cCrystal Ball\u201d, feeding off of Lord Frye\u2019s two-slap drumming and a flourish of acoustic strums. Finding those kind of momentum shifts inside such a well-defined sound makes *Heavy Window *more than a one-shot energizer. Garage rock records often lose their juice after repeat plays like, well, overchewed bubblegum. But Apache Dropout know how to find new paths even while sprinting. You won\u2019t hear anything besides garage here, but inside those confines you\u2019ll hear a lot.</p>\n<p>Still, nothing Apache Dropout does is likely to convert the garage-averse. But the funny thing is, when <em>Heavy</em> <em>Window</em>\u2019s playing, I\u2019m not thinking this is great garage rock\u2013I\u2019m just thinking it\u2019s great music, and that jibes with Apache Dropout\u2019s smart take on the past. They use it for what they need rather than getting lost in it for its own sake, making music that points to itself more than its influences. Some retro-sounding records are good examples of a time or a sound, but *Heavy Window *is a lot more direct than that.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>A trio of long-striving Midwestern music geeks, the members of <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/apachedropout\">Apache Dropout</a> spent years riding the currents between punk and free-form noise only to wind up back in their Bloomington, Ind., basement bashing out <em>Nuggets</em>-worthy skronk-pop. It's a good thing they did: In a year crowded with psych-rock reboots and garage rock re-thinks, the band's <a href=\"http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/album/apache-dropout\">2011 self-titled debut</a> stuck out.</p>\n<p>Rather than favoring the minimalism of 1980s UK groups like Spacemen 3 and Loop (long the go-to influences for stoney lo-fi basement bands) or a relentless Stooges-style chug, Apache Dropout drove the wayback machine even further into the past, choosing to emphasize the shuffling, swinging rhythms of old weird rock'n'roll. Songs like &quot;Sam Phillips Rising&quot; dialed in the necessary amount of pummeling repetition and echo-drenched vocals, but broke the monotony using rhythmic cues swiped from country western 45s, bubblegum pop jingles, and goofball R&amp;B. In its most sublime moments (See <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIcuBed9YVY\">&quot;God Bless You Johan Kugelberg&quot;</a>), Apache Dropout came over like a heavier, foggier take on the Cramps.</p>\n<p>Aside from a modest increase in fidelity, <em>Bubblegum</em> <em>Graveyard</em>, the trio's second LP, doesn't tamper with the formula too much. Their thematic focus has drifted away from 60s mind-expansion pulp and toward vintage horror comic book imagery. The lead track, &quot;Archie's Army&quot; sets the tone, with singer and guitarist Sonny Alexander yowling about a deep, dark, bubblegum graveyard populated with undead Jugheads.</p>\n<p>Apache Dropout don't try to imbue their drug rock with spiritual heft, tragedy, or greater meaning. The lyrics set a scene-- a surreal suburban teenage stoner-void that the Dead Milkmen could probably appreciate-- but any shreds of literal meaning are second to the delivery, the fever-pitched cosmic yelping that's intended to cultivate a freak-out appropriate environment at concerts. On that front, Alexander's a pro. He grunts and growls and bleats with the deranged power of a pre-meltdown Roky Erickson, bringing a kind of mad scientist desperation to the group's cover of the 1910 Fruitgum Company's otherwise benign nugget, &quot;1-2-3 Red Light&quot;.</p>\n<p>It's only when Apache Dropout indulge their pulpier interests too faithfully that they run into trouble. &quot;With fingers dark and eyes that glow, the shrieking in the woods cannot be good,&quot; sings Alexander on &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, plying standard-issue campfire creepiness over jangling guitars.&quot; And &quot;Robbin' the Bank&quot; is a little too unimaginative in its appropriation of old-school country bad-guy-hero balladry. These aren't bad songs, but when compared to <em>Bubblegum</em> <em>Graveyard</em>'s stellar, weirder moments, they're a bit of a let down. When Apache Dropout manage to get fully swept up their own wacko energy-- like on &quot;I-80&quot; or &quot;Carryin' Fleas&quot;-- or when they just focus their thoughts on the weirdness of ther Midwestern stomping grounds, though, they carve out an intimidating spot in a crowded scene.</p>\n",

Their music, while not abhorrent, is clearly packaged to sell a minimum number of records to the fewest number of listeners. I think they actually put a great deal of thought into this sales strategy.</p>\n<p>Why would I say such a thing? Other than me being a jackass, there are solid reasons for my conclusions. What we have here is an LP ('long-player'), but in name only. Not in practice, because in practice, this thing registers fifteen tracks and clocks in at a whopping fifteen minutes. Again: fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes. Long-player. I'll do the math for you: that's 60 seconds per song.</p>\n<p>Have you guessed the genre yet? Yes, you have, because you're smart. Sure enough, these folks play punk music-- more specifically punk of the spaz-out, hardcore variety. With a dash of 'art', in that they're incredibly fucking pretentious. Mr Neutron plays guitar. Baldo plays the fucking bass. In a questionable move, vocalist/crack addict Brad Mowen takes ownership of the project and uses his real name. Vocalist is probably the right term for Mowen's approach to making noise, one which at times sounds like a small dog's cry for help. At others it sounds like a small Glenn Danzig's cry for help.</p>\n<p>Now is the part of the review where I don't tell you anything about the songs. Check that. Here's your nugget: they all sound the same.</p>\n<p>Not to minimize Baldo or Mr Neutron's accomplishments, I will disclose the following to you: I was smiling for the larger part of this album. For one, Mowen had me in stitches, his voice spanning the full spectrum of dissonant, unintelligible nonsense. And the music, however concise, isn't all bad. It certainly has volume. And tempo. Sure, they never take the time to rock completely, but I sense that wasn't exactly the point.</p>\n<p>Fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes, long-player. Not much more to this disc than that. I imagine your choice will be about as simple.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/\">Aphex Twin</a> has always contained multitudes, and in the two years since Richard D. James returned from his extended hiatus, we have been reminded not only how many different facets he has, but also how good he is at compartmentalizing them. Each of his last three releases has shone the spotlight on a different aspect of his identity. <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/\">Syro</a></em>, his comeback album, was a bold, virtuosic, big-tent statement in the vein of <em>I Care Because You Do</em> and the <em>Richard D. James</em> <em>Album</em>\u2014a showcase of all his talents across a variety of rhythms, timbres, tempi, and techniques. The hermetic, atonal <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/\">Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt2 EP</a></em>\u00a0featured James in his mad-scientist lab coat, going to town on MIDI-controlled player pianos and programming robotic gizmos to thwack at drums. And <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20872-orphaned-deejay-selek-2006-2008-ep/\">Orphaned Deejay Selek (2006-2008) EP</a></em> gave us James\u2014technically recording as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/111-afx/\">AFX</a> this time\u2014in dancefloor destroyer mode, laying waste to the rave at 150 beats per minute.</p>\n<p><em>Cheetah</em>, his new EP, shows us yet another side\u2014at first, you might even say a simpler one. The record's tempos are, for the most part, slower than on Aphex Twin\u2019s last few records, and its beats are straighter. You might think that\u2019s a bad sign; after all, much of James\u2019 genius has always been his dizzying rhythmic dexterity. But James\u2019 take on four-to-the-floor is not like other producers\u2019 approach to the same cadence. Even here, his sense of swing is unparalleled; accents flick to and fro with abandon. Machine claps splash like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ba1CNOLiI\">Baka water drumming</a>, and 32nd-note fills spill forth like bags full of ball bearings. Crucially, with his beats less busy, it has left James more room to focus on spine-tinglingly rich tunings and timbres. And that\u2019s where <em>Cheetah</em> really stands out: To sink into it, preferably on good headphones or better speakers, is to be immersed in woozy, viscous frequencies far more vivid than you\u2019ll find almost anywhere else.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s particularly true of openers \u201cCHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum]\u201d and \u201cCHEETAHT7b,\u201d both of which trudge along at a torpid 100 beats per minute. Their titles reference a British electronics company called Cheetah that was active in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s; the particular instrument to which they pay homage, and which James presumably used to make them, is the Cheetah MS800, a short-lived digital synthesizer that has been <a href=\"http://www.gforcesoftware.com/extras/syntharchive/cheetah-ms800\">described</a> as \u201cone of the most unfathomable instruments ever made.\u201d (When <a href=\"https://blog.zzounds.com/2016/06/25/aphex-twin-cheetah-summer-namm/\">Warp surprise-premiered <em>Cheetah</em> at Nashville's NAMM convention</a> in late June, they displayed an MS800 under Plexiglas.) What makes the MS800 unusual is its wavetable technology\u2014or, as described in the <a href=\"http://studio250.fr/docs/divers%20claviers/Ms800Manual.pdf\">user manual</a>, in a phrase Warp repurposed for *Cheetah\u2019*s press release, \u201csounds programmed to sequence through changing waveforms as the note plays, giving exceptional movement and character to the music.\u201d</p>\n<p>You can hear and feel that mutability in action: The synthesizers in \u201cCHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum]\u201d move with a slippery, sidewinding motion, and the phaser applied to the drums feels almost greasy. Those wispy, warbly qualities give it a creepy, vaguely gothic air that's reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/\">Cure</a>\u2019s <em>Seventeen Seconds</em>, which is certainly not a thing I ever expected to find myself saying about an Aphex Twin record. \u201cCHEETAHT7b\u201d uses some of the same sounds and melodies\u2014both tracks, it seems, are variations on the same core material\u2014and its synths give off an eerie, palpitating glow. It\u2019s remarkable what different moods he can evoke from such similar sets of sounds: Where \u201cCHEETAHT7\u201d is calm and meditative, \u201cCHEETAH2\u201d rolls with a sly sort of swagger, like someone in wraparound shades driving a convertible very deliberately around the block, leering.</p>\n<p>Two short, ambient sketches show off the MS800\u2019s mercurial properties in even greater detail, but the centerpiece of the EP\u2019s latter half is a pair of tracks whose titles reference the <a href=\"http://www.sequentix.com/cirklon.htm\">Sequentix Cirklon</a>, a multi-track hardware sequencer that also turned up in the titles of two <em>Syro</em> tracks. Here, we\u2019re back in slightly more familiar territory: Both tracks ride the kind of snapping electro rhythms that were common on Rephlex records throughout the \u201990s; \u201cCIRKLON1\u201d plies the kind of na\u00efve, winsome melodies that have been James\u2019 stock-in-trade from the very beginning, while \u201c<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18386-aphex-twin-cirklon3-mix/\">CIRKLON3 [\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f\u00a0Mix]</a>\u201d\u00a0ropes some hyperactive slap bass into the mix. Both are case studies in beat-based electronic music in which no two bars are alike: they are wriggling dynamos, and wrapping your head around all their moving parts is a little bit like herding centipedes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one other aspect of James\u2019 personality showcased on <em>Cheetah</em>: the archivist. He first revealed that side of himself in 2015, when he <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/648-if-this-aphex-twin-archive-is-fake-we-dont-want-to-know-what-real-is/\">uploaded nearly 300 old demos</a> to an <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user18081971\">anonymous SoundCloud account</a>, and he continued in the same vein with <em>Orphaned Deejay Selek</em>, his first official release of vintage, previously unreleased tunes. Two of *Cheetah\u2019*s core tracks, it turns out, were included in his monumental SoundCloud dump, under slightly different names: \u201cCHEETAHT7b\u201d (as \u201cCHEETAH7 Teac\u201d) and \u201cCIRKLON3 [\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f Mix]\u201d (as \u201cCHEETAH3 Teac\u201d). What\u2019s striking about the versions included on the new EP is how much better they sound. They\u2019re clearly the very same recordings as those that went up on SoundCloud, but the rough versions sound like they\u2019ve been wrapped in a dozen layers of cheesecloth; they're flat and muffled where the polished versions boast the sharp angles and bright gleam of quartz crystals. When James uploaded all that material to SoundCloud, it seemed like he was washing his hands of it, throwing it out so that he could move on. But it looks like one more aspect of his personality intervened: James the obsessive-compulsive, determined to make one final pass at perfection. Lucky for us, too.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>By God, it's looking like Aphex Twin has gone full Energizer Bunny on us\u2014which, given his interest in robots that bang drums, actually makes perfect sense. This time last year, Richard D. James was seven years into an extended hiatus (or nine, or 13, depending upon the alias) when <a href=\"http://warp.net/\">Warp</a> launched a hot-air balloon emblazoned with his logo into the skies over London. Since then, the occasionally press-shy, always unpredictable artist has cranked himself up to a fever pitch, and there's no evidence that he's headed back to his hermitage any time soon.</p>\n<p>In the past year, we've been treated to a wealth of new, or at least new to us, music. First there was <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/\"><em>Syro</em></a>, Aphex Twin's triumphant return. Then, just four months later, came <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/\"><em>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</em></a>, an EP of more abstracted material, inspired by the intersection between robotics and acoustic instruments.\u00a0Right around the same time, James <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/648-if-this-aphex-twin-archive-is-fake-we-dont-want-to-know-what-real-is/\">launched a series of anonymous accounts on SoundCloud</a>, where he unloaded more than 100 previously unreleased tracks from his voluminous archives.</p>\n<p>If the title of the new release is to be believed, we're still in archival territory. (To that end, the cover art riffs on Warp's very first release, Forgemasters' <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Forgemasters-Track-With-No-Name/master/79596\">&quot;Track With No Name&quot;</a>, from 1989.) That the record is credited to AFX and not Aphex Twin is probably significant, although, as with all things related to James, there's room for interpretation. The AFX handle has come to mean different things at different periods: In the '90s, with the <em>Analogue Bubblebath</em> and <em>Hangable Autobulb</em> series, it meant rugged, percussive workouts with a touch of acid. For 2005's <em>Analord</em> series, it came to stand for lyrical, all-analog jams. <em>Orphaned Deejay Selek</em> is closer to <em>Analord</em> and provides a stark contrast to the labyrinthine twists of <em>Syro.</em> These songs soar with a burly kind of grace.</p>\n<p>But <em>Orphaned Deejay Selek</em> is no <em>Analord 12</em>. For one thing, many of the <em>Analord</em> releases sound positively lo-fi compared to the eight tracks here. The separation of the sounds in the mix, and the way they stake out a position in space, is nothing short of spellbinding.\u00a0 He's also not kidding about the &quot;deejay&quot; part of the title: These really are some of the most straightforward pieces of music that James has put his name to in years. They're far more focused on rhythm, on that ineffable quality known as the groove, than either of his other recent releases.</p>\n<p>James dives right in at 144 BPM on &quot;dmx acid test&quot; and doesn't let up, tearing through five tracks at the sort of tempos that haven't often been heard in techno since the '90s. &quot;acid test&quot; puts twin 303s through their paces while he lays down hissing, snapping electro rhythms; that track seamlessly gives way to &quot;oberheim blacet1b&quot;, a slightly more baroque variation on the same theme that gives free rein to his wild, microtonal tunings. &quot;simple slamming b 2&quot; is just what the title suggests, right down to the four-to-the-floor kick drums and rolling, 16th-note hi-hats.</p>\n<p>Towards the end he slows down. &quot;NEOTEKT72&quot; riffs on deliriously detuned synthesizers over a loosely funky beat, full of lanky tambourine and cowbell patterns; the closing &quot;r8m neotek beat&quot; recalls the spindly minimalism of 1994's <em>GAK</em> EP. The slowest track here might be the most surprising: &quot;midi pipe1c sds3time cube/klonedrm&quot; bumps away at 100 BPM, with wheezing synth-flutes and sad, sour bongo drums like some half-melted rainforest diorama in a gone-to-seed wax museum.</p>\n<p>But the keystone of the entire record is the one with the most understated title: &quot;bonus EMT beats&quot;. In DJ parlance &quot;bonus beats&quot; used to mean two- or three-minute filler cuts, often found on the B3 of a standard 12-inch EP, in which the A-side's beat, and maybe its bassline, was given a brief, stripped-down reprise. They were DJ tools, basically, meant to be juggled with. &quot;bonus EMT beats&quot; is clearly a rework of &quot;dmx acid test&quot;: it's got the same hard, dry snare thwack, the same staggered kick drum, the same ricocheting rimshots. The bassline's been muted and the reverb pushed way up. It rolls so naturally that it may take you a moment to notice what's changed: the bonus beat is in 5/4 time, whereas the original counts out in four. What's stunning is that James could take a cadence so unusual and make it feel so natural. For nearly five minutes, he wails away like a prog-rock titan on a drum throne. Usually, drum solos like this one make for an easy punchline, and you suspect that James may be teasing us here\u2014breaking it down, building it up, toying with the reverb, refusing us so much as a note of melody, self-indulgent to the max. And on and on it goes. Three records into his return, on the most Spartan cut of the bunch, James is sounding more energized than ever.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>You had a feeling this was going to happen. After returning last year from more than a decade of light activity, Richard D. James is back with his second Aphex Twin record in four months. If <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/\">Syro</a></em> was a masterful summation of the sound James pioneered on his classic 1990s releases, <em>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</em> is a reminder that there was always a lot of low-profile experimentation going on alongside the canonical LPs. Rather than cobble together <em>Syro</em> leftovers (it\u2019s fair to assume there are many of these), James draws from a different aesthetic altogether. It\u2019s all there in the title: whatever the process for actually assembling these tracks, the individual sounds do indeed seem to be physical objects vibrating in space, as if James had marshaled a battalion of robots to realize his latest compositions.</p>\n<p>Texturally, the music bears some similarity to bits found on <em>Drukqs</em>, specifically the prepared piano tracks that contrasted with that album's more frenetic breakbeat excursions. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFsD8Pn3qw\">&quot;Jynweythek Ylow&quot;</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMFb1aMhD3U\">&quot;Strotha Tynhe&quot;</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vu-W0CvFs\">&quot;Penty Harmomium&quot;</a>\u00a0are clear antecedents to the music found here, but <em>Acoustic Instruments</em> takes those ideas further. Piano, prepared and otherwise, features heavily, but so do various drums and wood and metal percussion instruments. And where James used to offer his electro-acoustic pieces as a showcase for lyrical melodies, about half the music here consists of crisply arranged beats, with loping drum lines that occasionally veer toward funk.</p>\n<p>The most striking thing about <em>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</em> (the title is a typical James puzzle\u2014no word of where Pt 1 may be) is how directly his musical concerns can be mapped on to another context. The grooves, the de-tuned melodies, the bridges, the way rhythms can lag a split second behind the beat\u2014all are signatures of his electronic work and all are found here intact. A good point of comparison demonstrating how difficult this must be is <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/481-acoustica/\"><em>Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin</em></a>, an album from a decade ago that found the new music ensemble tackling some of James\u2019 better-known compositions. The skeleton of tunes like &quot;4&quot; and &quot;Meltphace 6&quot; was there, but the sense of movement was way off. Here, we can hear the person and the sensibility behind the sounds.</p>\n<p>On some tracks, you can almost hear their electronic counterparts. &quot;diskhat1&quot; features clipped drums with a steady hi-hat and a prepared piano riff that sounds dissonant to the point of seeming alien. &quot;hat5c 0001 rec\u20134&quot; is constructed with similar tools but uses a piano motif from the bass clef to give it the anxious feel of a tightly-sequenced synth. &quot;piano un10 it happened&quot; can be filed with James\u2019 most delicate and beautiful pieces, one of those effortless melodies that vanishes into the air right around the time you start thinking about the <a href=\"http://windhaming.com/windham-hill-discography-100/\">Windham Hill catalog</a>. Indeed, brevity is key: <em>Acoustic Instruments</em> is the perfect length\u201428 minutes long, 13 tracks, with about half fully fleshed out and the others serving as sketches\u2014for this sort of treatment. James has a handful of ideas, he comes in and executes them perfectly, and then he gets out.</p>\n<p>If <em>Syro</em> was a re-introduction for James, a way to put his music in front of people who didn\u2019t know or follow along with his earlier work, <em>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</em> is a release for established fans, people who want to know what his pieces would sound like in an altogether different setting. So while the EP feels like it can be connected to other music (it\u2019s easy to draw lines to gamelan music and kinetic film scores), the greatest pleasure comes in knowing where it came from and how it came to be. It\u2019s an Aphex Twin EP more than just an EP, and as those go it\u2019s very good.</p>\n",

It\u2019s a new album of new music recorded in the last few years, and it\u2019s said to be the first of more to come. Unlike MBV, it\u2019s not that James went away entirely\u2014in 2005, he released a series of <em>Analord</em> 12&quot; EPs as AFX, and there were a couple of low-key EPs as the Tuss. But with many-monikered electronic musicians, branding is everything: it\u2019s not an Aphex Twin release unless it\u2019s presented as an Aphex Twin release.</p>\n<p><em>Syro</em> is an unusual album to contemplate because its overall approach is not particularly unusual. Older fans of electronic music who followed along with James\u2019 shape-shifting in the 1990s may need to adjust their expectations slightly. On the evidence here, he has no interest in re-inventing his sound. <em>Syro</em> has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-9UvrLyj3k\">Come to Daddy</a>\u201d vocals or rushes of noise. On the other end of the spectrum, <em>Syro</em> doesn\u2019t cast James in a quasi-classical light; there's no \u201cserious composer\u201d tracks like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iiK4MgIPtI\">4</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSrMEsaNAM\">Girl/Boy Song</a>\u201d that beg to be arranged for string quartet. And there are no \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBS4Gi1y_nc\">Windowlicker</a>\u201d-like nods to pop, no attempts to smuggle some truly weird music onto the charts.</p>\n<p>Without all that, what\u2019s left? Sixty-five minutes of highly melodic, superbly arranged, precisely mixed, texturally varied electronic music that sounds like it could have come from no other artist. James throughout the \u201990s was an influence sponge; part of his genius was how he took ideas and ran them through his highly idiosyncratic filter. The bizarro highlights came when he put his own spin on genres, making jungle weirder, pop more unsettling, and piano music more gorgeous. <em>Syro</em> also absorbs many different sounds, from loping breakbeat to drum\u2019n\u2019bass to techno proper to hints of disco, but in a more subtle way. It has a way of making other genres seem like they exist to serve this particular vision. And it\u2019s a confident album precisely because it\u2019s not self-consciously pushing the envelope. Electronic music with a strong beat not intended for the dancefloor was, if not invented by this guy, certainly perfected by him. So with his first trip back from the wilderness, he\u2019s demonstrating exactly how it\u2019s done.</p>\n<p><em>Syro</em> scans as \u201c\u201990s\u201d in terms of form but is quite modern in its particulars. Music sounded <em>like</em> this in 1996, but it didn\u2019t sound quite this good. Whether James has acquired better machines or improved the way in which he records them, <em>Syro</em> contains some of his most tactile music; it\u2019s a headphone record par excellence, an hour-long feast for the ears. But as exquisite as all the fragments are in isolation, the heart of the record is its steady sense of momentum, all the more remarkable since the tempos are mostly relaxed and uniform. James has spoken of tricks he uses in sequencing to free his music from a ridged digital grid; whatever his methods, his rhythmic DNA is as identifiable as John Bonham\u2019s. There\u2019s a playful swing to his rhythms, with accents that dance on and around the beat, and that unmistakable drive is the frame upon which the album is built.</p>\n<p>The album\u2019s formal simplicity keeps the focus on the arrangements, especially in the first half. The ten-and-a-half-minute \u201cXMAS_EVET10 [120][thanaton3 mix]\u201d glides forward like a smooth stone over polished ice, allowing a new element\u2014a sly melodic twist, a stuttering shift in the beat, an unusually bassy groan\u2014to enter seamlessly in every bar. It\u2019s complicated but never busy, myriad parts cohering into a logical whole. \u201c4 bit 9d api+e+6 [126.26]\u201d mixes muted acid squelches with twinkly keyboard melodies, with barely-there voices intoning a few layers beneath, while the opening \u201cminipops 67 [120.2][source field mix]\u201d has wordless singing presented straight\u2014the one new wrinkle on the album\u2014and it\u2019s so naked it\u2019s disarming. The album gets a few clicks harsher in places, as on \u201cCIRCLONT6A [141.98][syrobonkus mix]\u201d, with its assertive bass grind and rubbery video game noises, but it never goes too far in that direction. The care and virtuosity with which these tracks were assembled is immediately obvious, but nothing feels difficult; the record\u2019s easy flow despite it all is one of its primary virtues, and there\u2019s something new to uncover with every listen.</p>\n<p><em>Syro</em>\u2019s tremendous focus on detail marks it as a more muted release in Aphex Twin\u2019s discography. The \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d, once an Aphex touchstone, is nowhere to be found; there\u2019s little here in the way of brute-force appeals to the lizard brain, and <em>Syro</em> is on balance more sophisticated and cerebral. And that silliness, that bratty desire to be noticed, was part of what made the Aphex Twin experience special. Some will miss it. But this record\u2014virtuosic, precise, but also alive with feeling\u2014has something else in mind. It\u2019s telling that the most extreme moment here is also the quietest\u2014the closing \u201caisatsana [102]\u201d, a painfully lovely minimalist piano piece recorded on a creaky upright with birds chirping away in the background. By that moment, the feeling of \u201cI\u2019m listening to a new Aphex Twin album\u201d has fallen away and the deeper beauty of <em>Syro</em> starts to sink in.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Cash. Dosh. Dough. Ducats. Dollars. Green. Cream. Lucre. Luciano. Flow. Call it what you wish, currency's agenda remains the same: get paid. Aphex Twin, AFX, Richard D. James, DJ Pritchard D. Jams Cash'n Carry, Polygon Window, Caustic Window, Soit PP, Q-Chastic, or The Diceman, by any other name, he'd still be the eclectic cult of personality electronic genius that we've seemingly known for years. He's been all about the Benjamins more than any of his fans would care to admit. He lives in a bank for Christ's sake! Prolific through the mid-90s, Richard D. James seems content now to frustrate fans with half-assed double-disc sets, blow ears with full-frequency acid-mashed DJ sets with the likes of Russell Haswell, and wow his closest mates with amazing tracks that might never leave his laptop.</p>\n<p>Today we are left with the scraps from his bygone days as a mischievous media icon, in a subdued pewter digipak containing two discs' worth of musical whoredom, as he remixes both the academic and the absurd with equal amounts of aplomb, pisstakes, and irreverence for the source material. That attitude helps it all go down, especially as he deals with the early 90s' alternative casualties of war. He reduces Curve's &quot;Falling Free&quot; to Toni Halliday's bare voice, rebuilding her as a siren calling amidst crashing acid throbs, and for years it has remained a watermark in James' remix repertoire. Seefeel's &quot;Time to Find Me&quot; stays surprisingly close to the original, adding a bit more percussion but keeping its 90s crunch crispy and intact. Similarly, he ratchets up St. Etienne's &quot;Your Voice My Head&quot; with some burping bass and metallic thumps, making the head nod. One hit wonders Jesus Jones have their forgotten &quot;Ones and Zeroes&quot; decimated to the point of grateful extinction, as not a scrap of their sound is audible over its six minutes. Instead, the Aphex Twin Hovercraft is in full regalia, all disembodied lucid dream formations hovering in haunted washes of dislocated drums.</p>\n<p>Most hilarious is what he does to millionaire simp Trent Reznor. Paid absurd amounts in an attempt to remix Nine Inch Nails and soup up his stuff with that Aphex action, James leaves the odious source tapes unheard on &quot;The Beauty of Being Numb Section B&quot;, opting for something equally obnoxious. Meandering on the keyboards for the first half of the song, he then decides to blow through a straw uninterestedly and cut up some wide-mouthed yawns for the remainder. Not exactly a great track, but apropos for the wretched artist in question. &quot;At the Heart of It All&quot; is similarly lethargic and half-assed, sounding like he slowed &quot;Ventolin&quot; down to 16 RPM and then poured on some slowly heaving, molasses-thick brass.</p>\n<p>Not that the more highbrow and academic musicians get a reprieve from the caustic magic: Gavin Bryars' near-perfect minimalist piece, &quot;Sinking of the Titanic&quot;, is drowned out by the droning of some well-heeled passengers on the boat, as loud metal drums slowly flood the mix and overtake it completely. While unmindful, it's a pleasant enough take on the composer. Less listenable is a track James spent a good deal of time tweaking, the ponderous Philip Glass orchestration of Bowie/Eno's &quot;Heroes&quot;, furious in its velocity and swooping sound manipulations, with strings gnashing about as Bowie's melodramatic squawks buzz by. The beatless structure he creates is interesting, yet it remains a cold take that you won't be returning to. More interesting is how he manipulates the easy-listening marshmallows of Mike Flowers Pops' &quot;Debase&quot; and twists it into something closer to his own take on Candyland.</p>\n<p>Loving care is given to his mates, though. He takes stabs at no less than five artists on his Rephlex label, all to the most interesting results. The Gentle People's &quot;Journey&quot; is a Paradise of extended exotica, like Les Baxter and tiki huts out on the MIR Space Station, where the repeated reverberated refrain of &quot;We're taking you on a journey,&quot; becomes a veritable mantra. Kinesthesia's &quot;Triachus&quot; could almost be a Tom Waits remix, all junkyard clanging and dust-caked noises, with slow swells of synth breaking through the metal clunks. His remix of 808 State's acid classic &quot;Flow Coma&quot; even has a twisted hip-hop feel to it, wheeling forward and back, popping and snapping as he spins and halts the frequencies masterfully. Baby Ford's house track is similarly frenzied, which is not surprising, as they're two of his more recent efforts.</p>\n<p>In hindsight-- and listening to this release, in particular-- it's easy to see how Richard James recycles his own ideas in the various remixes and his own songs. At the same time as he was doing his Joyrex bangers, he was also jackhammering the tracks for Mescalinum United. Meat Beat Manifesto's remix could easily hail from <em>I Care Because You Do</em>. And the string sounds that he honed to a cerebellum-slicing edge for his <em>Richard D. James Album</em> get trial runs not only through the Gavin Bryars track, but also through the mercurial mashing of goth-rocker Phillip Boa's &quot;Deep in Velvet&quot;, as well as the endearing remix of Thrill Jockey glitch resident Nobukazu Takemura's &quot;Let My Fish Loose&quot;. More Beat than beat-oriented, he loops some acoustic bass with flute trills, all the while abducting Aki Tsuyuko's little girl voice and taking it to various locales: the bottom of a well, the middle of a stirring pit orchestra, out on a pastoral countryside, and down through the cavernous alien world of ring modulation, twisting her gentle frequencies into a nasty extreme that's at once cute and irritating.</p>\n<p>Most surprising of all is what he does with one of his old <em>Selected Ambient Works</em> tracks. &quot;SAW2 CD1 TRK 2&quot; was always a favorite of mine; a lonesome Ligeti-like lilt lost amid dark funhouse mirrors. Here it's restored to its original version, as once heard on the John Peel show, in which the &quot;ambient&quot; track is merely an eerie backdrop for a vicious acid workover. The drums bubble and hiss like gas escaped from slashing ginsu blades, building into a delicious bumping middle section. It's such a delirious pleasure that it makes me question that perhaps the entire two discs of <em>Selected Ambient Works II</em> might merely be clipped of their nasty beats, and thus presented as mere halves of their former selves.</p>\n<p>So what we're left with is a set that could have easily arrived back in '97, with little or no loss of quality. That frustrating gestation period aside, many of the tracks here are certified classics, and it's nice to have them all in one place, best approached in small doses. Dated, yes, but James' ahead-of-the-curve deposits are still accruing enough interest to serve as a polite introduction to his oeuvre.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Stop me if this gets sappy. And it might. Because <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em>-- recently reissued by PIAS America-- was the very first electronic music I ever bought, and certainly the first I ever heard over and over again. Long ago, before I was old enough to drive, I would sit in a small, cluttered bedroom in my parents' suburban ranch house, absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc. The creeping basslines, the constantly mutating drum patterns, the synth tones which moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer, the strange noises that I'd be unable to identify even if I tried. Back then, Aphex Twin was making music like nothing I'd ever heard before.</p>\n<p>What's become apparent since is that I probably wasn't the only one affected. After last year's disappointing <em>Drukqs</em>, it's easy to forget that, back in the Warp Records heyday, Richard D. James was to this new breed of ambient and electronic music what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Sure, there were upstarts; \\xB5-Ziq, Squarepusher and Autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection hit shelves. But James was still the posterboy, the presumed ringmaster, single-handedly defining a style of music in the minds of many. Now, as a new wave of mostly twenty-somethings step to the forefront of IDM, redefining electronic music for the third time in a decade, it becomes more and more obvious just how far reaching James' influence was.</p>\n<p>There's nothing new about this re-release, aside from improved availability and decreased cost. But then, improving on this package would be near impossible. Sure, the music on <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em> may sound a bit dated (as does, to be fair, most electronic music more than a few years old), but there's no denying it was the defining statement of Warp's early years, and the foundation for the careers of bands like Boards of Canada and Plaid.</p>\n<p>The songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this disc's sequel. Technically, most fall into Brian Eno's broad definition of the style-- it can be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety. The music develops slowly, unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long as necessary-- the creeping keyboard loop of &quot;Schottkey 7th Path,&quot; for example, is continually modified throughout the course of the song, but never once eliminated from the mix-- but James would never be content as a mere follower in anyone's footsteps. His work here serves a model for what would come to be known as traditional IDM. A simpler version of the style we've grown accustomed to, certainly, but IDM nonetheless.</p>\n<p>James' early work is heavily indebted to early dance music, filled with beats so eminently danceable as to confuse those who only know him from the spastic drum patterns that came later. There's little of that here, though. <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em> is, rather, an album stretching back to the days before software allowed for heavy sampling or glitch technology. Drum machines serve as its backbone and synthesized bass and keyboard sounds provide the meat. Most of the songs follow a relatively basic formula as well. One element-- say, a synth melody-- is introduced and repeated, and as new elements are added with each go round, the song gradually builds to a dense, multi-layered swirl. This Ravel-esque approach flavors much of James' older material, and yet, despite the simplicity of his equipment and approach, the songs here are both interesting and varied, ranging from the dancefloor-friendly beats of &quot;Pulsewidth&quot; to the industrial clanks and whirs of &quot;Green Calx.&quot;</p>\n<p>Indeed, these early works do a fine job of showcasing James' ability to transform even the most seemingly mundane patterns into something unique and interesting. &quot;Hedphelym,&quot; for instance, is built around a relentless headache-throb clich\u00e9 of a house beat. But James surrounds the pulsation with an ethereal feedback that bleeds all over the track, leaving the percussion awash in a murky solution of synth tones, pairing dance music with ambience in ways the Orb never dreamed possible.</p>\n<p>Slightly more structured (and equally enjoyable) is &quot;We are the Music Makers,&quot; a track which follows a drumbeat and a bassline past a pair of intertwined synth loops and a repeated Willy Wonka vocal sample as simple keyboard melodies pour down from overhead. But the aforementioned &quot;Green Calx&quot; is the closest <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em> comes to the spastic trickery of which James would become such a pioneer. It matches pitchshifted tones and drum machines with a burbling bassline, assorted machine-gun synth interjections, the slightly effected tones of various pistons, motors, and machines, and even the occasional cartoon spring noise. Moments like these serve to foreshadow both James' later work, as well as the infinitely more complex twists and turns that IDM would make in the years that would follow.</p>\n<p>They say next to no one heard the Velvet Underground's first album when it was released, but everyone who did went on to start a band. Listening to <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em>, one can't help but imagine the seeds being planted in the imaginations of the lucky few who were there when it all began. Nestled in these simple, undeniably danceable tracks are the roots of contemporary IDM. And despite its somewhat primitive origins, the final product remains among the most interesting ever created with a keyboard and a computer.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><em>Drukqs</em>. Druck-kyoos. Drug use? Or just another one of the Twin's cryptic pranks? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n<p>After two years of public silence and what many had judged to be his final exit from the world of corporate music, the original IDM iconoclast has returned with another puzzle. The problem with <em>Drukqs</em>, a two-disc, 30-track medley that allegedly wraps up Richard D. James' contract with Warp Records, is that there's really no puzzle at all.</p>\n<p>This album charts familiar Aphex territory, surveying styles he's plied on previous records, rather than suggesting new directions. It says something that Aphex enthusiasts expect James to reinvent himself with every record, and that the general reaction to this album (which has been trading hands over online piracy channels for months) has been somewhat unenthusiastic. From a man who has made a career staying a step ahead of his fans, an album as conventional as <em>Drukqs</em> comes as a sad surprise.</p>\n<p>The stylistic pastiche here mirrors many different points of James' career. Most of the tracks are brief melodic exercises conducted on piano and harpsichord, styled after &quot;Nannou&quot; from the <em>Windowlicker</em> EP. There are several purely electro-acoustic excursions, some in the cacophonous vein of the &quot;equation&quot; song on <em>Windowlicker</em>, others more reminiscent of the lysergic drone of <em>Selected Ambient Works II</em>. &quot;Bbydhyonchord&quot; and &quot;Orban Eq Trx4&quot; emulate the rhythmic, sensual sounds of <em>Analogue Bubblebath 4</em>, or the softer facets of <em>I Care Because You Do</em>. Abrasive electro pieces like &quot;Omgyjya Switch7&quot; and &quot;54 Cymru Beats&quot; steal the show, grafting drill-n-bass beats onto stark mechanical backdrops that recall James' early Joyrex releases.</p>\n<p>But <em>Drukqs</em> showcases Aphex's crude instrumental contemplations to a fault. His production talents have their bounds, and they wear a little thin when he dons the mantle of artistic maturity, attempting to imitate Erik Satie. &quot;Father,&quot; &quot;Avril 14th,&quot; &quot;Strotha Tynhe&quot; and &quot;Jynweythek Ylow&quot; rove dangerously close to the Windham Hill new age aesthetic of the 80s.\\t&quot;Prep Gwarlek 3b&quot; and &quot;Kladfvgbung Micshk&quot; take the formula to a more sophisticated, brooding level, but fail to bring anything exciting to a sound that Philip Glass pioneered more boldly 25 years ago. These languid noodlings comprise over half of the album; take them away and the cracks begin to show in <em>Drukqs</em>' monumental 30-song promise. In the end, with all the filler, this monster packs a lot less punch than some of Aphex's shorter releases, like the legendary <em>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</em>, or the <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> EPs.</p>\n<p>James fares better in other arenas. A muffled, throbbing pulse propels &quot;Gwely Mernans&quot; through a macabre tableau of disembodied strings and white noise. Though not on par with the best ambient work in Aphex Twin's canon, this song weaves a compelling web of mood and texture. &quot;Hy a Scullys Lyf a Dhagrow&quot; takes ambient music to the other extreme with a disjointed demonstration of ear-shattering sonic sleight. &quot;Gwarek2,&quot; one of the most chilling additions yet to James' demented repertoire, sounds like a stripped down take on \\xB5-Ziq's &quot;Mr. Angry.&quot; Tortured screams resonate through an abandoned foundry, joined by the unsettling clamor of clashing metal and screeching vermin.</p>\n<p>&quot;Meltphace 6&quot; delivers in signature Aphex style, with brisk snares trading fire over a wash of solemn synthesizers, thick squelches and warbling, high-pitched flourishes. &quot;Mt. Saint Michel Mix+St. Michael's Mount&quot; carries the torch, matching its relentless drill-n-bass torrents with simple, innocent refrains. In its final minutes, the song frays into a stuttering swarm of dissected, time-spaced samples-- certainly one of <em>Drukqs</em>' finer moments.</p>\n<p>Other honorable mentions include &quot;Vordhosbn,&quot; whose wistful and occasionally dissonant timbre is offset by the biting ring of blistering drums. Imagine &quot;IZ-US&quot; with Venetian Snares operating the drum kit, and you'll get the general picture. The protean &quot;Ziggomatic v17&quot; runs through several movements-- frenzied electro breakcore and anthemic 4/4 warehouse techno, interspersed with lush melodic passages-- before tapering off with a soft refrain.</p>\n<p>&quot;Taking Control&quot; is concentrated Aphex acid. The scathing electro breaks and spliced, vocoded samples evoke memories of &quot;Humanoid Must Not Escape&quot; from <em>Joyrex J9</em>. But the absence of engaging melody and firm structure keep &quot;Taking Control&quot; and a several other songs (&quot;Cock/Ver10,&quot; &quot;Afx237 v7&quot;) from really enveloping the listener. The sterile, clinical feel and limited palette of the heavier electro numbers renders them grating, one-dimensional and sometimes entirely unlistenable.</p>\n<p>Even the successful drill-n-bass pieces offer only shallow satisfaction. They sound like throwbacks to the past rather than prospects on the future; and for all of their compositional strength, there's an element of the Aphex Twin mystique missing.</p>\n<p>This record simply doesn't inspire the same degree of astonishment and awe as its predecessors-- seminal works like <em>I Care Because You Do</em>, <em>Selected Ambient Works II</em> and his last proper full-length, 1997's <em>The Richard D. James Album</em>, which not only struck fans on a personal level, but often reshaped the way they listened to music. <em>Drukqs</em> speaks a familiar tongue, instead of inviting us to learn new languages; it gives us the answers before asking the riddles. In this sense, it defies every expectation we had of Richard D. James. But in hindsight, it seems to show that some conventions are worth following.</p>\n",

More specifically, it is the work of Berlin-based producer <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/\">Apparat</a>, commissioned by German theatre director Sebastian Hartmann for his 2012 production of Tolstoy\u2019s <em>War and Peace</em>. While these cold facts could perhaps appear impenetrable on paper, <em>Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre)</em> is a delightful challenge to both fixity and expectations.</p>\n<p>There are many layers of response at work here and, similarly, as many reflections and echoes between the various responses. It was the result of intense collaboration between Hartmann and his cast, Apparat\u2019s Sascha Ring and the musicians he involved, and with the ever-shifting nature of the production itself during the making and staging of it with the score performed live by an orchestra each night. That inherent sense of flux permeates every note on the album; it surprises at every turn. The delicate music box chimes of \u201cK&amp;F Thema\u201d seem to come from nowhere, like sparks of vibrant light shooting up from the stark, watery landscape of the preceding \u201cBlank Page\u201d. Swelling strings proceed to engulf the chimes until they themselves are cut short, succumbing to distant drums sending out a warning. \u201cK&amp;F Thema (Pizzicato)\u201d is, as the title indicates, a plucked variation on the main theme, conveying a level of affected yet affecting sophistication. The desire to join the dots in the bigger narrative is strong: is this the aristocracy\u2019s last dance before the war fractures their insular way of life?</p>\n<p>Swimming beneath Ring\u2019s orchestral arrangements is a primordial soup of sonics: the falling of rain outside a window, the awkward tumble of unknown objects, a shrill whirl of drills. The hustle and bustle of these sounds ground the grandiose orchestration in the real world, give it an abstract sense of the mud and blood-splattered physicality of war. Ring\u2019s skill here recalls the work of cult techno producer <a href=\"http://www.dummymag.com/features/2011/10/21/my-hero-apparat-on-torsten-proefrock/\">Torsten Pr\u00f6frock</a>, a man he has previously paid tribute to for instilling in him \u201cthe idea of sounds having a patina [...] That sounds really needs something like that-- a little dirt is always important in your music.\u201d There are also lines to be drawn with the work of cellist Julia Kent who incorporates found sound into her recordings. On an even wider level, it speaks to the many conversations going on in contemporary composition today: briefly, about whether to embrace electronic means, as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/\">Anna Meredith</a> has done, or uphold tradition in composing solely for orchestra.</p>\n<p>Ring has, of course, come to the orchestra from the other side of the fence. It was his last album <em>The Devil\u2019s Walk</em>\u00a0that first found him breaking with his techno production past to more fully incorporate instrumentation and his own singing voice. While there's a touch of mid-90s, prog-rock musical theatre to the two vocal tracks on <em>Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre)</em>-- \u201cLight On\u201d and \u201cA Violent Sky\u201d-- it's not unwelcome.\u00a0Ring\u2019s orchestral and electronic score communicates the narrative\u2019s swing from complacent luxury to riveting despair, showing what happens when worlds collide.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://www.apparat.net/\">Apparat</a>'s Sascha Ring has kept busy the last few years with various mixes and side projects-- an entry into the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14794-dj-kicks/\">DJ-Kicks series</a>, his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12959-moderat/\">Moderat collaboration</a> with fellow Berliners Modeselektor-- but hasn't released a proper solo album since 2007's <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10515-walls/\">Walls</a></em>. That record, which brought together electro-shoegaze sweep with a vocal-driven pop approach, felt like a breakthrough for him. In place of the dance-floor glitch of his early-2000s work were songs with hooks, and his sense of lush atmosphere gave them a certain weight and grandiosity. Writers mentioned 1990s dream-poppers <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/\">Slowdive</a>, and that seemed like an apt comparison for the velvety digital fusion he was exploring.</p>\n<p>Of course, a lot's changed in four years, and Ring's latest LP, <em>The Devil's Walk</em>, arrives at a time when vocal electronic music is more popular than ever. Though his style differs quite a bit from guys like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/\">James Blake</a> or the chillwave set, there's nonetheless a bigger audience for pop set to programmed beats. And anyone checking in for the first time should find plenty to like here, right off the bat. Particularly in the record's front half, Ring shows off formidable production skill, wrapping his whispery vocals in some straight-up gorgeous arrangements. Synths swell up and retreat, drums skitter in and out frame-- there's a lot of motion but it's got grace and purpose.</p>\n<p>But this isn't an instrumental record, and in order for it to succeed on multiple levels, the lyrics and songwriting should be on point, too. That happens some of the time-- &quot;Song of Los&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15949-black-water/\">Black Water</a>&quot; showcase Ring at his most emotive, his melancholic vocals and phrases yearning and nearly anthemic. But several of these tracks have a vaguely cheesy, power-ballad quality about them. It's a hard thing to put your finger on, but much of <em>The Devil's Walk</em> seems like it was intended to be &quot;epic&quot;-- there are plenty of whisper-to-a-roar builds, at least on the vocal side-- and this pursuit of bigness gets tangled up in overly sentimental, conventional radio-pop delivery.</p>\n<p>For example, if you were to remove the sparkling backdrop from &quot;Escape&quot;, you'd be left with something that resembles a B-level <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/\">Coldplay</a> song, complete with some eyebrow-raising imagery of &quot;the street rushing beneath&quot; and &quot;cracks in the concrete.&quot; Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of awestruck emoting; it just feels like a weird fit with Apparat's sonic approach, this very thoughtful and intricate techno. The styles work against each other. So, in the end, the record is a disjointed listen-- there are some really beautiful and even moving stretches but too many missed opportunities to truly bring together Ring's love of pop with his natural gift for beats.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The fourth installment in a markedly busy year for !K7's <em>DJ-Kicks</em> series, Apparat's (real name: Sascha Ring) contribution is also the least predictable. Part of that has to do with how difficult it is to describe his music, an ambiguous form of electronic dance where texture varies greatly from one sound to the next. In his world, if a reverbed guitar echoes overhead, then perhaps the hectic clickity-clack of skittering drums will offset it, rapidly stapling it down. And each sound in an Apparat track seems like it was created using different tools, so that guitar strain might reflect the smoothness and shine of silk while each of those percussive instruments sounds like a completely different kind of metal was used to sculpt it. Since Apparat has such a wide array of textures at his disposal, his possibilities for a mix seem vast.</p>\n<p>Of the three 2010 <em>DJ-Kicks</em> mixes prior to this one-- Juan MacLean, Kode9, and James Holden-- Apparat's most resembles the latter. Where MacLean blurred distinctions between house music old and new and Kode9 tried to pack as many funky/dubstep records into a small space, Holden went a different route: He took a number of disparate records and tried to make them resemble his own aesthetic. MacLean and Kode9 were selecting and mixing tracks in order to make a banging mix; Holden was selecting and mixing tracks to make a banging album. Likewise, Apparat digs through his collection in an attempt to make an Apparat-sounding album out of other people's music. Though in so doing, he shows his cards a bit, suggesting that his sound could be loosely categorized as one where experimental electronic music edges further into indie territory.</p>\n<p>Between Holden's and Apparat's <em>DJ-Kicks</em>, Holden's gets the edge, and it's not even because he selects better tracks. Ultimately, Holden is the better sequencer, with a stronger understanding of the rhythm and pacing of a mix. Apparat finds his groove during a stretch in the middle beginning with Four Tet's remix of Born Ruffians' &quot;I Need a Life&quot; and ending at Vincent Markowski's &quot;The Madness of Moths&quot;, possibly the best patch on any of the four <em>DJ-Kicks</em> this year, but there's a lack of a defined arc over the course of these 24 songs. When Thom Yorke's &quot;Harrowdown Hill&quot; appears near the end, its placement feels odd and disjunctive, as if your roommate came in and decided to drag one of his favorite songs into a playlist you spent hours making.</p>\n<p>That's a shame, because Apparat does have a knack for conveying his aesthetic through other people's music, especially when he blends two records that shouldn't work together but do. It's most indicative here when the chirrup of small, echoed percussion on Phon.o's &quot;Intervall&quot; peppers the muffled sadness of Burial and Four Tet's &quot;Moth&quot;, enhancing an already smoldering track. And the way Apparat mixes his exclusive <em>DJ-Kicks</em> track, the operatic techno of &quot;Sayulita&quot;, is similarly representative of this skill. Arriving just after the dryly funky dubstep of Joy Orbison's &quot;The Shrew Would Have Cushioned the Blow&quot; and a couple tracks before the expansive ambience of the closing track, Tim Hecker's &quot;Borderlands&quot;, Apparat demonstrates how his exacting attention to detail unites him with artists from all over electronic music's terrain.</p>\n",

In and around the few dutiful pop tracks on <em>Walls</em>, his third full-length, Ring has made one of the best electronic dream-pop records in a while, somewhere in the tradition of M83, Slowdive, Junior Boys, Schneider TM, and every other act to trip out on dense, blissy echoes and thinky, under-the-covers slowness-- not the kind of album that asks for your attention, but the kind that seduces you into it.</p>\n<p>For most of his career, Ring has been a favorite in a specialized niche: As a producer, he has a reputation as a digital-processing wizard. The guy can chew up drums into alien machines, stretch strings out into hazy pillows, and stitch the resulting parts together in space like a dream; it's made him a hero to that cognoscenti that's less interested in the actual dancefloor and more interested in the sophistication of the techniques behind it. And on last year's <em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em>, Ring shared billing with Ellen Allien, an artist with enough name recognition-- and enough of a pop sensibility-- to introduce his work to a lot of new headphones.</p>\n<p><em>Walls</em> is certainly trying to follow up that line: There's a lot of the same seamless blending of electronic notions and pop ones, with small bits of production genius gathering themselves up into big, melodic, vocal-friendly sweeps. Thing is, Ring doesn't actually seem suited for the kind of pop that, you know, <em>pops</em>: His style is too subtle, too relaxed, too head-in-the-clouds. His collaborations with Allien would always veer back to some kind of big, gritty thump-- on his own, Ring stays gentle and dreamy, too lost in the rich stew of his sounds to ever grab you by the throat and demand attention.</p>\n<p>So it's the squinty-eyed pop tracks toward the beginning that don't entirely hold up. &quot;Hailin' from the Edge&quot; and &quot;Holdon&quot; both sound good on first listen, Ring setting up muted, futuristic r&amp;b thumps and clicks behind pop vocals from Raz Ohara-- a few times through, though, and you can sense a self-consciousness in them, a certain awkwardness. Push through to tracks like the two-part &quot;Fractales&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Arcadia&quot;, and you feel like you're getting into the territory where Ring would rather be: The sound of a guy who's gone just a little tired out on dance music, who's as interested in string quartets as kick drums, who just wants to escape to the studio and stretch sounds out into blurry clouds and the hiss of escaping steam.</p>\n<p>You hit &quot;Arcadia&quot;, in fact, and this turns into a dream-pop triumph. &quot;Arcadia&quot; might start out with a mechanical, Allien-esque beat, but Ring uses it to push little wisps of synth around like watercolors, while a falsetto vocal glides and wanders through. On &quot;You Don't Know Me&quot;, he does the same with strings, shepherding them through tight harmonic changes and up into a grand, stately climax. &quot;Headup&quot; has him singing softly against an ocean of reverberating voices that seems like a direct nod to the shoegazer band Slowdive-- even before a spacy guitar line comes in to punctuate the changes.</p>\n<p>It's a shame Ring didn't set out to construct his entire record along these lines, because they're where he finds his greatest successes; the urge to strike while the pop iron is still hot may have painted him into a few strange corners. But as a path to follow after <em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em>-- a path for listeners even more than for Ring-- this is a terrific one: The best of these tracks combine the mechanized pulse and sonic possibilities of techno with good old bliss-out dreams better than anything in a while.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The restless creations of prolific Berlin-based Sascha Ring (aka Apparat) have always seemed unfixed and polymorphic even by the transitive standards of experimental IDM, with albums like 2003's <em>Duplex</em> actively oscillating between electronic and acoustic instrumentation as well as various jittery micro-idioms. Though his techniques have typically resulted in music that is both wildly unpredictable and compulsively listenable, the continual evolution of his productions has left him with few distinctively recognizable sonic trademarks. Perhaps that's beginning to change, however, with the release of <em>Silizium</em>, an unusually refined and focused five-song mini-suite that finds Ring and his collaborators satisfyingly integrating classical elements into melancholic electronica.</p>\n<p>Originally recorded for a John Peel session at BBC in 2004, <em>Silizium</em> (the German translation for &quot;Silicon&quot;) features extensive contributions from a string section known as Complex\u00e1cord, comprised of cellist Lisa Stepf and violinist Kathrin Pf\u00e4nder. Several tracks also include chilled vocals from electro-soul crooner Raz Ohara, as well as some fiery jazz licks from clarinetist/sax player Hormel Eastwood. Apparat binds these disparate elements together with agitated, frayed beats and spellbinding electronic drones, providing these five uneasy pieces an intense, cohesive urgency.</p>\n<p>With Ohara's voice carrying its pensive melody, the driving clatter of &quot;Komponent&quot; emerges following the brief instrumental &quot;Introduction&quot; like an emergency vehicle weaving its way through commuter traffic, while Stepf's spine-tingling, attenuated cello notes sound a siren over the din. On the subsequent title track, Eastwood's blaring reeds gradually give way to a simple, repetitive melodic motif from the strings, before Ring huffs and puffs trying to blow the house in with his termite-ridden beats. Ohara takes over again on the cinematically taut, insistent &quot;Not a Good Place&quot;, defiantly keeping his choruses afloat upon a surging tide of fractured keys and strings, before everything finally drains out into the quiet pools of the chamber-like &quot;It's Gonna Be a Long Walk&quot;.</p>\n<p>Those five tracks sound like an extended composition, and are further augmented by an adventurous (if somewhat redundant) quartet of remixes. Bus' remix of &quot;Silizium&quot; enthusiastically chews everything down to unrecognizably tiny pieces, while Telefon Tel Aviv's take on &quot;Komponent&quot; adds enough swirling indie-pop texture that it almost resembles a long-lost Talk Talk single. Apparat closes things up himself, giving &quot;Not a Good Place&quot; one final, yearning spin as its concluding microscopic violin notes flutter off like drowsy fireflies, allowing <em>Silizium</em> at last a hard-won interlude of peace.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Music criticism (and listening for that matter) is never an exact art. As context shifts, so too does a record's resonance and weight-- looking back at 2003, I couldn't help considering which albums I had under- or overrated. Among those that I listen to more often now than I had thought I would are Richard X's <em>Presents His X-Factor, Vol. 1</em> and Tobias Thomas' <em>Smallville</em>. Richard X is pop distilled, from start to finish, but Thomas' mix disc glides gracefully from the beatless to buoyant without any jarring moves. It's no surprise, then, that its bridge-crossing center features a couple of tracks from the Berlin-based, Kompakt-distributed, Marco Haas (T. Raumschmiere)-owned Shitkatapult label, whose minimalism and skittery, almost glitch-like beats marry the ambient and the experimental.</p>\n<p><em>Smallville</em> includes a track each from Swede Anders Ilar and Finn Sami Koivikko-- two of three members of the Shitkatapult roster to release albums in 2003. The third is Apparat (Sascha Ring), whose <em>Duplex</em> LP veers away from the dub-meets-ambient and tech-house paths walked by Ilar and Koivikko, respectively, and sticks closer to more familiar, worn IDM roads. What Apparat does so differently from most of his bleeps-and-bloops counterparts is saturate the listener with a variety of sounds, from the sandpaper glitch of &quot;Granular Bastards&quot; to the horn-laden &quot;Negro Modelo&quot; to the tone poems of &quot;Contradiction&quot; and &quot;Wooden&quot;, each of which feature vocalist Klas Yngborn.</p>\n<p>Despite his prevalence for creating a frozen ambient base in which he can skate and etch different grooves, Apparat is most engaging when he takes a maximalist approach. Which isn't to say that <em>Duplex</em> is an album of all left turns-- it's simply powered by its will to continue moving forward, never allowing its songs to settle firmly into melodies, nor leading its listeners merely in circles. Indeed, Apparat brings these songs to life by delicately coaxing a range of sounds from his IDM core: tracks such as &quot;Interrupt&quot; and &quot;Warm Signal&quot; begin with low hums, but seem to yearn to break out of their shells-- and when they do, whether it's with warm tones or a thumping bass, the effect is that same: a sort of journey not so much through sound, but from it, an audio exploratory than seems organic and somehow idyllic. &quot;Wooden&quot;, with its martial beat and quivering melody, almost sounds avant-folk, delicately blending the acoustic and electronic like one of George's tracks through the woods.</p>\n<p>Saxophone and clarinet, Eastern melodies, road-movie-meets-Western guitar, Aphex-like bouncing balls, and the childlike ticks and tocks of Plone also adorn the record, each emerging naturally rather than seeming like window dressing. The result is clicks and cuts without the bells and whistles-- an IDM record you can love in a time when too many artists working within the genre seem as if they'd rather merely impress you.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The young Dutch electronic\u00a0producer Pascal Terstappen has numerous assets, any one of which would be enough to build a strong aesthetic. He has a keen ear for melody, a terse, supple way with rhythm programming, and a sensitive dowsing rod for strange gems and ores hidden under timbral crust. His humid webs of synthetic tones and bass, drums, and treated voices are full of graceful curves and slants. Each intonation of a motif is unique as a piece of hand-blown glass. Best of all is his knack for startling, bafflingly perfect changes in tack, which is in fine form on <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/advance/22-dreaming-in-key/\">Dreaming in Key</a>,</em> his new record as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28238-applescal/\">Applescal</a>. His music's slippery momentum and Frankensteinian melodies seem designed to delight rather than unsettle. Among fellow deconstructive electronic musicians, he makes for a uniquely genial as well as interesting companion.</p>\n<p>Loops are naturally, stubbornly additive, but Applescal's are so pliant that the music feels conscious, especially at points of transition-- prone to pausing and gathering itself before swirling into a new form. At the top of a long, warming rise, you're as likely to find a frosty plateau or a side-winding shift as a sheer drop. He's not interested in forward motion; instead,\u00a0he develops overlapping concentric circles of melody and rhythm, like rain dappling water. With shades of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/\">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/\">Four Tet</a> in its spacey melody and Morse code percussion, &quot;Onetasker&quot; teases at catharsis before finally unleashing one huge, woozily droning chord. The percolating beginning of &quot;Vintage Clown / Shadow Hunters&quot; abruptly slumps into a post-R&amp;B vocal fantasy, which is gradually split open by geysers of molten synths. The stellar &quot;On the Way&quot; starts at an oozy lope but ends in a glorious pile of marbled, backmasked melody, making the old technique feel fresh.</p>\n<p>Applescal is profligate but consistent with genre: He likes to combine springy tech house arpeggios, intrepid harmonic explorations, and tilted minimalist percussion with hefty ambient stuffing and a sparkly veneer of 90s IDM. It's mind/body music in the lineage of James Holden's <a href=\"http://www.bordercommunity.com/\">Border Community</a> label output, seeping fluidly between kinetic ecstasy and moody solitude. Applescal's versatility and vision caused his prior records to meander sometimes, bogged down by surplus ability and eagerness. That's what makes this more sharply focused third LP a great entry point-- though it wouldn't be Applescal without a certain amount of meandering. He vamps well, working filters and oscillators the way a jazz keyboardist works a modal scale. But his music is most compelling at its most structured, when he carefully draws different elements into uncanny wholes. The best example is still 2010's &quot;Dialeague&quot;, where the warmest, most thickly rolling drones and the coldest, thinnest swirl of notes breathe in unison, though it's now rivaled by\u00a0&quot;On the Way&quot;.</p>\n<p>As an opener, &quot;Boys&quot; is intriguing but limited in scope, with exhalations and hisses atomized over exfoliating arpeggios and locomotive drums. The live version of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12802-el-diablo-ep/\">&quot;El Diablo&quot;</a> is a little too like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3638-ratatat/\">Ratatat</a> for comfort, and closer &quot;Keep on Dreaming&quot; feels like an afterthought. But everything else on <em>Dreaming in Key</em> is rich, vivid, and full of surprises. The dreamy &quot;Lonely People&quot; draws songful metallic pulses into an almost fugue-like structure, while the visceral &quot;Spring and Life&quot; has a bassy carved-out menace recalling Booka Shade's &quot;Darko&quot;. Standout &quot;Wise Noise on Time&quot; channels <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/\">Pantha du Prince</a> with its tinkling, starry variations, but not before a ghostly melodic line suddenly leaps up to a squeal and hangs there, forming a yawning chasm around a steely bass. Among heavy competition, it's one of my favorite &quot;Applescal moments&quot; so far, the kind where a solid form seems to be pulled out of thin air.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>With his 2009 debut LP, <em>A Slave's Commitment</em>, 22-year-old Dutch producer Applescal announced himself as a formidable new talent. His sound was highly approachable; familiar yet fresh. His songs often recalled the sleek architecture of Boards of Canada and the slithering pulses of Four Tet, with a hint of the Traum label's distinctive sparkle. But at their best, they packed a sultry wallop that felt like an emerging voice of Applescal's own. Compared to the mean rhythmic slant and melodic punch of highlights like &quot;In the Mirror&quot;, linear vamps like &quot;I Can't Stand&quot; felt indistinct. He sometimes got caught up in showing off what he could do, rather than what he could envision. But his vigor and ability made even the lesser tracks worthwhile.</p>\n<p>It looks like we have to keep waiting for Applescal to get past his impulsive streak. Little has changed on <em>A Mishmash of Changing Moods</em>, and why should it have? It's only been eight months. The album is more focused than its inauspicious title suggests, but as on <em>Commitment</em>, Applescal has produced about an EP's worth of dazzling material padded with the kind of competently stimulating tech fantasias you feel like he can crank out all day. His skill as a sonic architect is always at the forefront, and he's great at taking a handful of thematic elements and making them dance with graceful complexity. In the tension between nested rhythms and overarching melodies, beleaguered drum machines struggle to keep time before snapping back into place. Synths are filtered every which way. The sounds are so finely tailored you can feel the unique shape of each snare.</p>\n<p>But at his best, Applescal gets past minutiae and dreams up modular, interlocking universes of sound, with multiple motifs. <em>Mishmash</em>'s first two tracks feel like warm-ups, though the ghostly vibes of the first make for a nice introduction. It really gets going with &quot;Dialeague&quot;, his best and most unique work to date. The contrast between warm static and icy-clear melody is instantly immersive. It feels visionary and spacious. All of the bull's-eyes have something special that makes them stand out from the album proper: The curving, radiant spray of &quot;The Key of Genes&quot;; the ominous bass flicker of &quot;MC Iron&quot;; the thick, juicy groove of &quot;In Theory&quot;. This high bar makes what would otherwise be totally solid spitting-drum and shrilling-synth workouts sound rote, a little pointless. Applescal seems limited only by a youthful urge to use everything, right now, as emphasized by the long, weird, unfinished-feeling closing track of <em>Mishmash</em>. Once he gets past it, look out.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>No sphere of music has more genre padres, underappreciated geniuses, or DJ auteurs than dance. So it's refreshing to know there are young guns in the game: <em>A Slave's Commitment</em> is the debut LP from 21-year-old, Amsterdam-based Pascal Terstappen for the venerable Traum label. Released as Applescal (get it?), Terstappen's <em>A Slave's Commitment</em> arrives after just one 12&quot; on Traum earlier this year (he also has four EPs to his name on different labels). A humid, pattering imagining of Traum's glittery, spiked dance music, <em>A Slave's Commitment</em> promises more than it delivers while announcing Terstappen's presence.</p>\n<p><em>A Slave's Commitment</em> introduces not just a new artist, but new music as well: It features 11 exclusive Applescal tracks and a remix of Local Daddy's &quot;Sjeesh Up&quot;. Terstappen seems deeply committed to the album as a form, as <em>Commitment</em> feels more than balanced (in fact, its back half is somewhat superior) and the vocals that close the &quot;Sjeesh Up&quot; remain the only hiccup in Terstappen's woozy, compressed world.</p>\n<p>It's a world built out of electronic sounds that will be familiar to fans of crossover electronic acts of the past few years. The strident, deliberate melodicism of late-90s Warp Records (the Boards of Canada-indebted &quot;The Forms of Abstract Life&quot;), the trance-like pop repetitions of the Field (&quot;The History of Love&quot;), and the skybound synth-tronica of M83 (&quot;Nottingham Hobbits&quot;) are all reference points. This isn't to damn Terstappen's credentials, however--\u00a0<em>Commitment</em> is sturdier and more beat-conscious than any of the above acts' records.</p>\n<p>Despite his oft-warm soundscapes, Terstappen has a bit of a bend to him. &quot;In the Mirror&quot; begins with a bass rumble and unadorned beat before adding a creeping minor-key melody, giving the track strange, noir-ish grit. &quot;Funk &amp; FC&quot; exhibits a paranoid, skittish streak that borders on the most coherent and clear-eyed strands of (gasp) IDM.\u00a0<em>Commitment</em>'s standout track is &quot;How Heroes Die&quot;, which behaves almost like a rock song from the flat, machinated snaps of its opening moments. From there: gorgeous, hill-like synth patches, pulses that drift over what might be a bridge, and a gorgeous, ascendant convergence of these elements before a slow fade. It's a familiar formula, and cynics might note that this kind of major-key hope-stirring (ignore the song title) is a little bit like hitting baseballs off a tee, but damn if Terstappen doesn't swing hard.</p>\n<p>There are less inspired moments: the tech-y &quot;Ugly But Nasty&quot; mostly lives up to its title and, at over eight minutes, does so for a long time. The Local Daddy remix is an odd choice for a rookie showcase, its vocals obtrusive and weird (could've been a great B-side). Committing to an album format makes a lot of sense for Terstappen, as Applescal is unlikely to thump on dancefloors. Moreover, <em>Commitment</em> plays evenly, even if no one would complain about an EP of remixes and extended edits of &quot;How Heroes Die&quot; or &quot;Nottingham Hobbits&quot;.\u00a0<em>Commitment</em> would be better if it were weirder and more singular, but for now, Terstappen's waxy, roomlit beats make for fine evening companions.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><em>Imperial Metric</em> proves that I shouldn't give up on anyone. Appliance's previous releases, <em>Manual</em> and <em>Six Modular Pieces</em>, got on my nerves with their blatant conformance to the post-rock blueprint: two parts early Stereolab, two parts Sonic Youth, two parts Tubeway Army-by-way-of-Trans Am, and a dash of Plone/Broadcast bitters. It sounded like a style-mag committee drummed up the concepts, and negotiated to do away with the band's energy to make room for blank posturing.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, with <em>Imperial Metric</em>, Appliance have redeemed themselves, an album that, while stylish, never seemed coutured. The band have created a fascinating blend of post-punk dub, primitive electronics, and Soviet-menace nostalgia. It could have been so hokey! But Appliance keep a straight face throughout and their expressionist devices overdriving throughout.</p>\n<p>Beginning with a concr\u00e8te squiggle, &quot;Separate Animals&quot; soon finds its solid squelch groove, as vocalist/guitarist James Brooks growls, &quot;You live on the left/ Your mind is on the right/ The city's full of people/ You're speaking to the speaker.&quot; While Brooks develops this bipolar theme, the rest of the band sets the synths to gloomily pound and squirm. If they weren't so serious about it, you could call it camp.</p>\n<p>A muted trumpet delivers a twisted reveille call at the opening of &quot;Map of the Territory,&quot; and a Jason Pierce-emulating Brooks delivers a darkly blessed warning that &quot;silence has left a hole wider than a mile.&quot; Amidst all these mechanical prophecies, Brooks plucks away at a crippled guitar figure tormented by trumpet. &quot;F.L.F. (Precious Bodily Fluids)&quot; is an altogether more peaceful affair, which could be nicely reworked for the glitch-tech crowds that bug out to Herbert's <em>Bodily Functions</em>.</p>\n<p>&quot;Land, Sea and Air&quot; rocks back and forth on muscled heels. Here, Brooks' guitar recalls Bunnymen guitarist Will Sergeant in his vintage <em>Crocodiles</em> era-- though blips and burps attempt to bury him, Brooks is unwavering in his commitment. The instrumental &quot;Comrades (in a Moscow Hotel)&quot; is ironically calming by comparison. But beneath the pads and aloof percussion, there lurks a John LeCarr\u00e9 paranoia.</p>\n<p>Appliance lose their footing with &quot;H2O.&quot; The track which opens with the same rushing glisten that haunted Bj\u00f6rk's &quot;Hunter,&quot; but collapses when Brooks sings about the &quot;H2O in his mouth running low&quot; and &quot;on his skin, running dry, running thin.&quot; Drummer Dave Ireland gamely tries to distract us from the overwrought lyrics by thumping the daylight out of his kit in a passable homage to Death in Vegas' &quot;Aisha.&quot; Unfortunately, the serial murdering character Iggy Pop portrayed on that track wasn't around to round off the effect.</p>\n<p>While the instrumental &quot;Skylight&quot; sounds like an Air remix of Public Image Ltd's &quot;Careering,&quot; &quot;AM/PM&quot; gives bassist Stuart Christie an opportunity to showcase his Peter Hook-like talent as various analog effects thread around him and Berlin-period Bowie synth washes settle a polluting pall over Brooks' dejected vocals (&quot;Well, I'm falling down/ I couldn't try/ You and me/ It's a fine line&quot;). &quot;Navigating the Nursery Slope&quot; is <em>Electricity</em>-era OMD propelled by Neu!'s signature motorik rhythm.</p>\n<p>After the Spacemen 3-style narco-lullaby of &quot;A Gentle Cycle Revolution&quot; and the Augustus Pablo-meets-New Order sound of &quot;Navigating the Nursery Slopes,&quot; the album settles into slumberous quiescence with &quot;Where Has the Space Race Gone?,&quot; the epitome of Cold War nostalgia. Here, Appliance reference every theme they've developed over the course of <em>Imperial Metric</em> in an eight minute instrumental recalling the second side of Bowie's <em>Low</em>. That icy bliss stills the album at its close, and we leave Appliance certain that they've escaped the foul-ups of their past. By saturating themselves in the stealth-and-bunker, spy-counter-spy politics of the mid-to-late twentieth century, and the skeletal electronics of that wary era, Appliance consummately fulfill their potential.</p>\n",

By now, forward-thinking listeners have at least a smattering of options that offer a rewarding, if challenging, listening experience, thanks to the work of dizzy-headed beat freaks like D\u00e4lek, Glen Galloway, and the Anticon alchemists. Those artists not only defy presupposition, but have turned out some true class from the fickle, irresistible bitch that is hip-hop.</p>\n<p>Traveling similar spaceways is Apsci (&quot;applied science&quot; foreshortened), the product of funk-punk-turned-b-boy Raphael La Motta, his wife/Aussie chanteuse Dana Diaz-Tutaan, and Def Jux workhorse DJ Big Wiz. Pairing La Motta's glitchy production and Wiz's turntable textures looks great on paper, a prospect even more enticing when Big Apple luminaries like TV on the Radio vocalist Tunde Adebimpe, Mart\u00edn Perna of Antibalas, and hip-hop intellectual Mike Ladd appear on <em>Twisted</em>'s tracklist. Add the assertion that the album is a physically unplaceable, cyberspacial collaboration, assembled from transcontinental airplane laptop sessions and portable studios in eight different countries, and Apsci's pastiche swells with creative possibilities. Unfortunately, even as the album dips into intriguing conceptual territory, the execution is pretty underwhelming, and the overall sensation is of a jumbo Roman Candle of creativity that fizzles out before it's even fully lit.</p>\n<p>La Motta's work with short-lived Thrill Jockey groove-grungers Vitapup precedes his style-mashing smarm with Apsci. There's a relieving sense of humor that thankfully underlines his straight-ahead, &quot;Hollywood Freaks&quot;-style whiteboy raps and sparse, sterile broken beats. Without that hipster smirk, La Motta's lyrics would be too vapid to call quirky and his production too flagrant to call experimental. Diaz-Tutaan's silky, versatile voice seems underused; she comes from an operatic background but here we get little more than warbled Baduizms. If La Motta's own delivery was stronger she'd perhaps shine brighter in his presence, but together the couple sound more like they're pillow-talking than performing.</p>\n<p>The album's first half makes Apsci's strongest statement, though a throwaway appearance by <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> host Don Newkirk only emphasizes where the album fails to go, as does the De La-inspired role call on &quot;It's Apsci&quot;. &quot;Tirade Highway&quot; and &quot;Never Give Up&quot; bring tentative electrofunk bump, the first riding Atari synthlines and subliminal effects over Diaz-Tutaan's showtune vocals; the second comping over a routine horn sample and phase-shifted beat, letting Diaz-Tuttan's voice do the heavy lifting. Adebimpe's heavenly croon adds atmosphere to &quot;Runaway&quot; and illuminates the New York indie influence on the album, his minor-key harmonies hinting at TV's moody ruminations. However, Perna's flute is only an afterthought in the sudsy &quot;Rob the Bank&quot;, with its brittle rhythms and Wiz's subtle scratching barely discernable, and &quot;Synth 3PO&quot; is a true low point, again falling back on the Beck blueprint of plastic sequined soul, without the surreal heart and giddy bluster.</p>\n<p>But like I said, you have to respect any serious attempt at excavating the proverbial pigeonhole. We analytical Po-Mo's like the ambiguous shades that fall just after sunset but before the heavy dark of night, the time when fireworks can be most vivid and startling.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It\u2019s easy to forget that AraabMuzik has successfully been making beats for close to a decade. The Providence producer's widespread allure arrived near 2010 when pop music fell head-first into the EDM scene. His 2011 debut LP <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/\">Electronic Dream</a></em>\u00a0capitalized heavily off that trend, with woozy dreamscapes that ultimately trickled into the humble rap beginnings from which he came (primarily Cam\u2019ron and his Dipset dynasty).</p>\n<p>It would be remiss to say AraabMuzik (born Abraham Orellana) invented the subgenre cloud rap, but he provided a sturdier framework for it, while producers like Clams Casino and Harry Fraud unlocked a bevy of samples often ignored by Araab in exchange for his rapid-fire MPC flexing. Videos circulated of him flapping his arms over the device like a Hindu deity, solidifying his dexterity as both a hip-hop producer and a catchy electronic one. A flood of mixtapes and EPs arrived in the sizable gap between <em>Electronic Dream</em> and\u00a0<em>Dream World</em>, yet AraabMuzik\u2019s place in beat-making feels uncertain right now.</p>\n<p>They say to tailor your resume for every different job that you want, so going by that theory, <em>Dream World</em> would land\u00a0AraabMuzik in any career field. The experience is there, but the project breathes an unspoken awareness that his signature sound is no longer just his. Clams and Fraud have popularized that atmospheric aesthetic, but other producers have taken to wedging random electronic blips into their work in an effort ride the trap house movement. So what we\u2019re left with on <em>Dream World</em> is a solid project that flies in multiple directions.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the dreamier cuts are there\u2014and arguably the best parts of the album. Opener \u201cAdonis\u201d blends Araab\u2019s MPC proficiency against choir chants and electronic key tones, reflecting a cult-meets-church vibe. \u201cMind Trip\u201d and \u201cFaded\u201d bring it back to the <em>Electronic Dream</em> era, pairing the producer\u2019s knack for ethereal voice samples with his hip-hop bassline foundation. A collaboration with producer !llmind proves successful, as \u201cDream\u201d highlights the vocals of newcomer Vchaney on a track that travels along the same vein as a Tinashe or Jhene Aiko joint.</p>\n<p>Araab even traipses smoothly into house territory on \u201cChasing Pirates,\u201d while his collaboration with Dvnk Sinatrv (\u201cWaiting For\u201d) is near perfect minus the Zedd-ish build-up synths\u2014the same crime is committed on \u201cStadium House.\u201d A few tracks are begging for any one of the rappers in AraabMuzik\u2019s rolodex, from the subtle boom-bappery of \u201cTrain Wreck\u201d to \u201cLeft Side,\u201d which recalls Scott Storch's stint with the Roots on keys. But on the flip side, there are other tracks where the vocal features seem extraneous. \u201c50 Box Of Swishers\u201d could have done without Kobe, despite his \u201cI came to get fucked up\u201d crooning over a hard hip-hop beat like he\u2019s Tony Sunshine during the Terror Squad reign. Speaking of throwbacks that don't really work, Araab inexplicably revisits dubstep with \u201cTry Me\u201d and \u201cA.M.\u201d, where the genre's signature \u201cwomp womps\u201d are literally just that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s understandable\u00a0to approach <em>Dream World</em> with demands for the mind-fuck AraabMuzik delivered on his debut. But for a producer who's now sailing along a flooded production market, his only buoy here is to try anything once. He could become David Guetta after this; he could also become DJ Mustard. But honestly, we just want AraabMuzik back. At this point, that\u2019s the real dream.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>AraabMuzik's done all right for himself since the beginning of the decade, and he owes a lot of that to his ability to diversify. He's an MPC-obliterating festival act, a trance-tweaking beatmaker of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/\"><em>Electric Dream</em></a> renown, and one of hip-hop's underrated secret-weapon producers. It's almost easy to forget that latter component of his resume, though, at least by comparison; when the EDM-adjacent buzz is throbbing almost as loud as the bassline, that'll take publicity precedence over, say, contributing the bulk of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15391-gunz-n-butta/\">a pretty good Cam'ron &amp; Vado record</a>.</p>\n<p>But Araab's still a beatmaker at the core, and even more so than the first installation, the sequel to last year's <a href=\"http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17697-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only/\"><em>For Professional Use Only</em></a> has the feel of a more traditional beat tape. That comes with all the mixed blessings that traditional beat tapes tend to be defined by: here's a direct feed to a producer's unadorned, uninhibited style, one that drastically careens between a fun listen for enthusiasts and a utilitarian toolkit. It's mixed, but it doesn't really set scenes or moods. It's a showcase for what makes his beats tick, but some moments feel incomplete and start to drag without actual MCs on the track. And even if his sound here swings further towards lower-key atmosphere better suited for box Chevys than rave tents, it's not iconoclastic enough to drop any surprises in his source material, hip-hop's Molly-hangover atmosphere, or his own discography in general.</p>\n<p>As a complete front-to-back listen, Araab's sound proves not all that exciting in this beat-tape form, where good loops\u2014&quot;Life&quot; and its diamond-refraction chimes, the synth-string tension and trunk-denting bass bump of &quot;808v&quot;\u2014never quite turn into good songs and flag a bit after four minutes of verseless midtempo inertia. When he does lay an extended vocal sample down, the constant repetition runs the risk of grinding out all the meaning and impact, like it does when the old <em>The E**ducation of Sunny Carson</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMO2K1j5VCc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m2s\">&quot;I got to take him off o' here&quot;</a> diatribe of the &quot;260&quot;/&quot;The Bitch in Yoo&quot; sample is cut through &quot;White Collar&quot;. Granted, straight-up instrumentals have their use; a clean 90 seconds of any of these tracks should keep a DJ set near peak highs, and every hip-hop radio station needs bumper music, but don't expect them to jump to the foreground and demand your attention unless you're a mixtape rapper in freestyle-candidacy mode. The form here is more <a href=\"http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/\"><em>Instrumental University</em></a> than the first <em>FPUO</em>, with a bit of difference-splitting that still acknowledges the way he's molded trance divas and hoover synths into his own building blocks the way a previous generation's producers upended R&amp;B.</p>\n<p>But that's only sort-of-bad news, really, and the moody-EDM vibe that his originals and remixes thrive off is still welcome enough. Tracks like &quot;Don't Pretend 1.5&quot; (Super8 &amp; Tab's &quot;Black Is Back&quot; sifted through a foggy trap drumroll) and &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (a canny midtempo gothification of JES' &quot;Ghost (Deepsky Club Mix)&quot;) pull some deep comedowns off minor-key melancholy, noir counterpoints (and counterparts) to the more blissed-out purveyors of cloud rap. What's left during the less mind-blowing moments, then, is an opportunity to bask in Araab's craft, pick up on how he still has a way of building and breaking down beats. Even his straight-up loops have a structure that's worth soaking in, where wallpapery bass churn conceals artfully timed snare rolls and skyscraper synths are built on a foundation of piston-punch drums.</p>\n<p>Some of this material has already been successfully field-tested. &quot;Money Talks&quot; dropped as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpagXT7gOV8\">a Fabolous showcase</a> on last year's Funkmaster Flex release <em>Who You Mad At? Me or Yourself?</em>, and it made for a solid dose of vintage East Coast soul-loop flow accompaniment. &quot;Keep 100&quot; came out a couple months back as a Slaughterhouse cut, where its combination of spacey prog loops and concussion-causing drums made for a powerful shit-talk backdrop. And there are already a host of hopefuls who tackled &quot;Ghost Story&quot; and the Halloween car alarm banger &quot;Black Out&quot; when they were Soundcloud releases and made their own rap tracks over them. Maybe that's the real benefit of this record: motivating others into new levels of their own professionalism.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In dance music, ideas become cornerstones, cornerstones become rules, rules become clich\u00e9s, clich\u00e9s\u00a0become memes-- and memes are made to be subverted. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/\">AraabMuzik</a> is one of the unlikeliest crossover stars to jump from hip-hop production to festival-scale electronic bass music, and it's largely because he treats that latter genre in the context of the former. Albums like\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/\">Electronic Dream</a></em> and\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17697-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only/\">For Professional Use Only</a></em> took an approach to beat-extending, break-isolating mixing that goes back four decades, and drew out some of the moodier, wilder elements of his source material using the oldest trick in the hip-hop book: repossessing the entire intent of a song by isolating one specific stretch of it.</p>\n<p>So much of the material that AraabMuzik's been dealing with over the past few years, from arena dubstep to pop-chart trance, rides on peaks-and-valleys successions of build-ups to bombastic peaks. AraabMuzik's mutation of that dynamic into a steady, prolonged all-peaks churn is the key: who says you have to\u00a0<em>wait</em>\u00a0for the drop? In that sense,\u00a0<em>The Remixes Vol. 1</em> isn't significantly different than his previous records' approaches. There's more of a feel of \u201cofficial\u201d business to it; much of the source material comes from the Ultra Music label and skews closer to the Electric Daisy Carnival aesthetic than anything AraabMuzik's worked with to date. But that's the closest there is to a unifying background to\u00a0<em>The Remixes</em>, which really does make his own choppily momentous, joyously abrasive, and widely sourced sense of rhythm the biggest common denominator.</p>\n<p>Mt. Eden's \u201cSierra Leone\u201d is a sort of mission statement.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16bRiH5zfOY\">In its original form</a>, it's as steadily composed and fluid as wobbly bass anthems get, a balanced split between hard bombast and billowy emotion that might sound like a maximalist <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/\">Clams Casino</a> if you stripped out all the wubs. Which is just what AraabMuzik does at the outset, juicing it up with orchestra hits and rearranging the beat so it's more distinctly hip-hop-friendly. And once the wobble-bass\u00a0<em>does</em> get dropped in, it's more of a rumbling shudder than the hyperactive hiccups in the original. Further elements of AraabMuzik's style show up in more transformative moments, like the nearly from-scratch rebuild of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6p5W30BV1U\">Wolfgang Gartner's Omarion-featuring \u201cStill My Baby\u201d</a>. That cut revamps its tweaky electro house chords into a more spread-out melody that stalks like a 1980s slasher-flick villain over a more traditional house 4/4, then unexpectedly disintegrates into a puddle of rattling snares that make a point of proving why the best trap comes from a miles-deep hip-hop grounding.</p>\n<p>Not that\u00a0<em>The Remixes Vol. 1</em> pins him to any genre constraints. Style trumps niche every time here, and in its efficiently compact sub-hour runtime there's plenty of opportunity to let that style run through all kind of territory. His take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/\">Skrillex</a>'s omnipresent remix of Benny Benassi's \u201cCinema\u201d cuts to the chase, as AraabMuzik lets that hyperventilating gatling-laser drop loop for long enough to make its overamped malfunctioning slot-machine spasm feel as simple and immediate as the \u201cAnte Up\u201d horns. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5636-steve-aoki/\">Steve Aoki</a>'s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/\">Kid Cudi</a>/Travis Barker collab \u201cCudi the Kid\u201d is saved from its flabby trance-n-bass excess with a slick minor-key pitch shift and a regrouping around a martial, mid-tempo slice of breakbeat. It's ambitious recontextualization, even if it gets away from him a little: another Gartner cut, \u201cCognitive Dissonance\u201d, lives up to the title with some abrupt borderline-trainwreck swings from electro to boom-bap that would work together as individual pieces. And his soulful remix of Taana Gardner's 81 b-boy disco staple \u201cHeartbeat\u201d sticks out amidst all this top-dollar superclub material like a banana-seat Schwinn Sting-Ray at the Tour de France, though it's no big dealbreaker when the worst thing you can say about a mix selection is that it makes you wish he'd do an old-school all-West End Records set.</p>\n<p>But the real thread here, characteristically enough, is mood. AraabMuzik's always had a tendency to twist even the most euphoric hands-up moments of EDM crowdpleasers into something more overcast and ambivalent, and that's what continues to keep his material compelling. It's easy to hear the excitement and flashiness in his beats, but there's just enough restraint and lingering darkness that it's like siphoning all the gloss off candy paint or replacing neon with flourescent lights. Turning big drops into hypnotic loops, ditching crescendos for churn, programming and manipulating beats that shudder restlessly in otherwise Swiss-timing rhythmic constraints-- this isn't simple edit work, it's an entire tonal shift. That said, there are two original cuts here. One is closer \u201cKeep it in Motion\u201d, a showcase for NoLa rapper Chase N. Cashe that, while a pretty straightforward money-flinging door-kicker with the MC on it, shows up earlier as an instrumental that reveals some tense, icy arpeggios driving those chattering snares. The other one's a sparse number featuring bleary, slowly floating chords and near-subliminal mournful choir vocals. The title? \u201cDarkside\u201d. Just so you know where he's coming from.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Forget the title of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/\">AraabMuzik</a>'s new mixtape and look at the cover for a second. That's the producer/DJ/MPC wizard rocking the Sahara Tent at Coachella last year: It was not only one of the wildest shows I had the pleasure of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8807-coachella-2012/\">witnessing</a> in 2012, it was the culmination of one of the strangest career arcs in recent memory. If you initially viewed Abraham Orellana's 2011 breakthrough <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/\"><em>Electronic Dream</em> </a>as a hip-hop producer making an instrumental record, it did what it was meant to-- it got Araab a lot more work. But as word spread about the extent of his talents, <em>Electronic Dream</em> became a preview of his must-see live sets, which translated to festival stages whether they primarily trafficked in EDM, hip-hop, or indie rock. Despite not being the &quot;official&quot; follow-up to <em>Electronic Dream</em> (there was also last year's collection of stray beats, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/\"><em>Instrumental University</em></a><em>),</em>\u00a0<em>For Professional Use Only</em>\u00a0feels like it's trying to reflect Araab's current status: It's bigger, bolder, and more ambitious than its predecessor*.* But the impact works in reverse-- it's meant as a <em>souvenir</em> for Araab's live sets while having the unexpected effect of showing his range as a producer rather than a performer.</p>\n<p>Of course, the obvious question is how <em>For Professional Use Only</em> can truly recreate the live experience without the visuals. There is undoubtedly a wow factor to seeing Araab perform, as he breaks down the last line of rockist defense against &quot;this music works better live,&quot; i.e., &quot;he's just pushing buttons.&quot; Which, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/lmEhCDRvQKA\"><em>hell yes</em> he's pushing buttons.</a> But the guy is about moving bodies for an hour at a time, not just dropping jaws in one-minute stretches. Even without his &quot;you are listening to AraabMuzik&quot; tag, he does have audio tricks that let you know it's him. He hasn't altered his approach in any significant way here; it's still punishing beats that repeat every four bars and jagged, spazz-out synth lines that are loud as fuck, most things that people find either attractive or repulsive about the EDM kings that have welcomed Araab and vice versa. It's also cut with short passages of twinkly MDMA rap that evoke the moment your drug of choice kicks in and you get to enjoy the high rather than the increasing buzz. There's plenty of moments where Araab revisits such ideas from <em>Electronic Dream</em> (&quot;Never Have To Worry&quot;, &quot;Turn Tha Tide&quot;), and it\u00a0can still be powerful in proper doses.</p>\n<p>On the whole, though,\u00a0<em>Professional Use</em> feels more based in hip-hop than\u00a0<em>Electronic Dream</em>, in tune with Araab's physical movements when he's not going hundred-hand slap on the MPC; it's typically him in an exaggerated, full-body headknock. It's interesting how much of it recalls late-90s Ruff Ryders considering that crew's willingness to act as a counterbalance to hip-hop's obsession with ecstasy and shiny suits; you hear the rudimentary tones of early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/\">Swizz Beatz</a> in &quot;Street Knock&quot;, while &quot;G Riding&quot; comes close to quoting the chunky old-school drumbreak of &quot;I'm A Hustla&quot;. Elsewhere, he tweaks existing templates for modern ears, as &quot;D.R.U.G.S&quot; and &quot;So Good&quot; respectively apply the stylistic tics of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/\">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/\">Dilla</a> into something cloudier. Occasionally, he gets a little too overt in his beat-cribbing: &quot;Heaven&quot; could pass for any number of faux-<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/\">Timbaland</a> beats from 1999;\u00a0&quot;Getting 2 The Point&quot; is standard issue Lex Luger/Young Chop and &quot;SUCCUBI&quot; is so blatant about its <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/\">TNGHT</a> envy that it <em>has</em> to be tongue-in-cheek.</p>\n<p>Still, Araab's willingness to stretch keeps <em>For Professional Use Only</em> engaging throughout, which is no easy task; it's 67 minutes long, about 15 minutes longer than a typical festival set and probably 15 minutes more AraabMuzik than anyone needs in one sitting. I wouldn't say there are too many dead spots here-- it's just that <em>you</em> might not have the stamina to keep up. Araab's beats have enough melodic heft and substance that you can listen for 40 or so minutes without thinking, &quot;Man, it'd sure be nice if someone was rapping over this.&quot; By the same token, his production doesn't have the same capacity for storytelling-- whenever a track goes past three minutes, there's a good chance it's overstaying its welcome.</p>\n<p>As with <em>Electronic Dream</em>, <em>Professional Use Only</em> is ridiculously loud and will drive you insane on headphones. I can't think of too many acts besides <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/\">Sleigh Bells</a> who make such explicit use of brickwalled mastering as a clear aesthetic choice, and it's worth noting that you <em>could</em> listen to both of their albums in the time it takes to finish <em>For Professional Use Only</em>.\u00a0Beyond the physical weariness, it also limits Araab when he tries to make beats that require room to breathe, such as the mid-00s <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/\">Kanye</a> fluff of &quot;Beauty&quot;. You don't need any background in trance music to appreciate these songs more deeply, nor do you need to be an audiophile beyond maintaining that,\u00a0&quot;if it's too loud, you're too old.&quot; If you hear\u00a0<em>For Professional Use Only</em> and imagine it pumping out of gigantic bass bins, you &quot;get&quot; it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In the time since\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.araabmuzikmvp.com/\">AraabMuzik</a> linked up with Dipset and pegged himself to their reemergence with the door-smashing\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKuWozzEhao\">&quot;Salute&quot;</a> beat, he's become a web-2.0 model of the hip-hop producer as brand, mapping his aesthetic vision onto an array of contexts. The surface-beautiful\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/\">Electronic Dream</a></em>, for example, introduced him to a wider audience in part because it veered from the tougher-sounding beats Araab makes for rappers. But it still made sense next to what came before, offering up an entrancing, self-contained sound that grabbed at dance club roots but darkened and abstracted its samples to suggest something private and intimate. And he has a serious live\u00a0reputation, with a unique approach to performance.\u00a0AraabMuzik is\u00a0a virtuoso percussionist whose instrument just happens to be an MPC pad, and longtime Dipset fans and fashionable interlopers alike elbow one another for space around his table, collectively freaking out over the physical spectacle. He's also booked for a Coachella slot this year, and says he's planning to release a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/45027-aap-rocky-araabmuzik-team-up-for-avpmuzik-project/\">collaborative project</a> with equally doted-upon Harlem rapper\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/\">A$AP Rocky</a>. You'd be hard-pressed to find a producer with as much reach as a solo commodity as Araab right now. He's having a moment.</p>\n<p>Given all of that, the timing of\u00a0<em>Instrumental University</em> feels off.\u00a0It's a serviceable sampler of harder-knocking beats cleaved off largely unmemorable recent releases from some of his most trusted collaborators-- <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/10940-lloyd-banks/\">Lloyd Banks</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/\">Fabolous</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6653-jim-jones/\">Jim Jones</a> and, of course, Dipset pals <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/\">Cam'ron</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29282-vado/\">Vado</a>, among others. And\u00a0while it's perfectly natural for a producer in\u00a0AraabMuzik's position\u00a0to make a beat tape-- it's a time-honored rap tradition, after all, and he's indulged before-- it's not something that fits the arc of his current upswing.</p>\n<p>As the cover implies, this is a release presumably aimed at beat nerds and aspiring rappers looking for tracks. That's disappointing if you're still high on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/\">Clams Casino</a>'s re-imagining of what this sort of thing can be-- his thick and stoned <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/\">Instrumental Mixtape</a></em> from last spring reinvigorated the idea of the producer as auteur instead of background figure. But\u00a0<em>Instrumental University</em> sticks to a more traditional script. Given the fact that he's charging money for these tracks (many of which first appeared on free mixtapes), and peppering them with his increasingly annoying drop, &quot;You are now listening to AraabMuzik,&quot;\u00a0<em>Instrumental University</em> might seem like a self-congratulatory stopgap if the beats weren't so consistently expert and sleek.</p>\n<p>He moves from the horror-film piano chords and signature echoey screams of &quot;1, 2, 3 Grind&quot; to the soul-sampling, nearly Dipset-classic vibe of &quot;Ain't Mad Acha&quot;. The same sensibility is obviously behind it, but these tracks are built from a very different foundation than those found on billowy\u00a0<em>Electronic Dream.</em> And because there are no beats taken from real <em>hit</em>-hits here (the instrumental from &quot;Salute&quot; and the unrelenting chipmunky smack of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/45099-araabmuzik-readies-new-beats-comp/\">&quot;Rubberband Stacks&quot;</a> are the closest we get), Araab avoids that unsatisfied lurch of anticipation for a familiar verse that never drops. In fact, there's a strong inverse relationship between the listenability of the instrumentals and the strength of the tracks with verses.</p>\n<p>So this is background music, sure, a workmanlike collection of beats that oscillates within a narrow but extremely proficient range of sound. Still, even for its failings as a proper album, <em>Instrumental University</em> is\u00a0still quintessential Araab, constantly walking the razor-sharp line between glimmery and ominous. At this point, he's still known first and foremost as someone who can pound the living daylight out of a set of MPC pads. But we're again reminded that his identity also rests in his\u00a0distinctive\u00a0ear for uneasy mood, a quality subtle and delicate and not tied to any one technique.</p>\n",

After a long period of complete disappearance, Cam's been going through something of a comeback lately, aided in large part by tracks like Araab's punishing &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epP7i7unWdU\">Get It in Ohio</a>&quot;. Araab's work for Cam, and for other freelance clients, sounds dollar-store cheap but knife-edge tense; it reminds me of Steve Jablonsky's score for <em>Friday the 13th</em>. He makes ferocious, diamond-hard gangsta rap beats with a pervading sense of dystopic anxiety. Araab's sense of vision comes through even more strongly in the web videos he's been releasing, in which he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXRnbS6o64U&amp;feature=related\">shows off his MPC virtuosity</a> and slices up samples of, oh, say, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82AKTZeMR3k\">Cannibal Corpse</a>. Like fellow underground rap visionaries <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/\">Clams Casino</a> and DJ Burn One, Araab makes freelance beats that hint at a fully developed personal aesthetic. And like those guys, he's now striking out on his own, making instrumental music that brings that aesthetic to the forefront.</p>\n<p><em>Electronic Dream</em> is Araab's first commercially available album, but it works more like a collection of remixes. Rather than creating his own tracks from scratch, Araab spends his debut album dismembering a series of cheesed-out hairgel-house superclub anthems: DJ Nosferatu's &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAZvroAWps\">The Underground Stream</a>&quot; on &quot;Underground Stream&quot;, Jam &amp; Spoon's &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7MgeHg0C8\">Right in the Night (Fall in Love With Music)</a>&quot; on &quot;Golden Touch&quot;, Starchaser's &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1-SUXCPahc\">So High</a>&quot; on &quot;Feelin So Hood&quot;. This is, to put it mildly, an unexpected direction for Araab. With a little bit of Googling, you can find plenty of online screeds from fans frustrated or even enraged at Araab for making an album based on this music, or for dishonoring his sample sources by leaving large pieces of these tracks unchanged while neglecting to properly credit the original producers. But Araab's changes, relatively minor though they may be, turn a sound built on populist uplift into something darker.</p>\n<p>It's tough to imagine the tracks on <em>Electronic Dream</em> getting any play in any dance club in the world, and it's virtually impossible to picture anyone rapping over them. Instead, this album is a genre unto itself-- ominous future shit that creates an atmosphere but never bleeds into the background. Araab's snare-hits resonate like eye-punches, and his drum-programming is pure, unrelenting rap shit. But he's applying that sensibility to songs where the melodies shine even when Araab's using a screaming sound effect as part of the rhythm track. The end result is a truly weird little album-- something at once anxious and euphoric.</p>\n<p>As hard as his drums punch, though, Araab still let the textures of these anthems shine through. And in Araab's hands, these melodies work differently; the anonymous dance divas wailing ecstatically over their original beats become lost, lonely souls, anxiously whispering to themselves that everything will be OK. Araab's music doesn't allow for dizzy buildups and cathartic breakdowns; instead, it's all murky tension, all the time. At times, his tracks can sound a bit like the woozy bass music of L.A.'s Brainfeeder scene, but Araab is always more direct and more ferocious than those guys. And yet the sugary beauty of those melodies sound like they belong on his tracks; nothing is out of place. &quot;Got a feelin' so high,&quot; the singer on &quot;Feelin So Hood&quot; coos, and the drums beat that feeling down while the gorgeous ripples of synth lift it back up.</p>\n<p>There's something truly fascinating about the entire LP: An up-and-coming hardcore rap producer leaving his genre behind so that he can twist and scramble this hands-in-the-air big-room sound. And in peeling back its excesses and substituting in his own eccentricities, Araab uncovers a primal emotional force in this music, one that fits beautifully with his own air-raid siren aesthetic. <em>Electronic Dream</em> is pretty, but it's pretty like the morning sun twinkling off of a dangling machete blade-- you don't want to fuck with it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Released in 2007, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/227-arbouretum/\">Arbouretum</a>'s sophomore album, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9815-rites-of-uncovering/\"><em>Rites of Uncovering</em></a>, put a darker, broodier spin on Americana. The album's opening track, &quot;Signposts and Instruments&quot; still stands as the Baltimore-based quartet's finest moment-- an ethereal dirge that seems far more otherworldly and bizarre than the its handful of slow-mo power chords should allow for. Delivered in an echo-laden whisper, singer/guitarist Dave Heumann imparted verses that sounded like the kind of stuff you'd find scrawled in a dream journal. If you're among those who hated groups like Band of Horses for their ordinary, work-a-day, lovey-dovey-ness, the doom-shrouded folk-moves on <em>Rites of Uncovering</em> had an appeal.</p>\n<p>In the years since, the band's struggled to strike a similar compromise between spirit-world imagery and Americana-tinged bar-rock. On their subsequent records, Arbouretum fortified its heavier inclinations. They became a tighter and louder band-- dialing in gritty fuzz tones and extending the free-form freak-outs beyond the 10-minute range-- but as the music's density increased, the haunting vacuum that defined <em>Rites</em> got squashed.</p>\n<p>On <em>Coming Out of the Fog</em>, the band's new album, Arbouretum's eerier inclinations are back in alignment with their amplifiers. As a lyricist, Heumann favors heavy subject matter-- suffering, isolation, mortal man's impossible struggle against natural or supernatural forces-- and he often saturates each line with a mouthful of syllables. &quot;I've no need of lampreys now nor the funerary ode,&quot; he sang on &quot;Tonight's a Jewel&quot;, arguably the most light-hearted number on <em>Rites of Uncovering</em>. In <em>Fog</em>'s quieter stretches, he manages to pack that broad spiritual sweep into simpler phrases. On the pedal steel-driven &quot;Oceans Don't Sing&quot;, Heumann sets a concrete scene-- longing for beach-side serenity-- before slipping into impressionistic language.</p>\n<p>Heumann still whips out esoteric lines, but he reserves his heaviest poetry for the band's noisiest and most repetitive music, where it can sit comfortably atop the battering, barely shifting grooves. On &quot;World Split Open&quot; the band rides a single grinding riff for all it's worth, while Heumann hurls out heady and arcane couplets.</p>\n<p>As a guitarist, Heumann channels a number of inspired shredders-- Neil Young, Richard Thompson, and even Western Saharan outfits, like Group Doueh-- but as a songwriter, he's the product of two influences: singer Will Oldham, with whom he toured as a backing guitarist, and Baltimore punk-rock-Gnostics, Lungfish, whose drummer Mitchell Feldstein has done time behind the kit for Arbouretum. The former provided a blueprint for his hyper-cerebral lyrics and staid melodies. The latter, pretty much everything else-- the sea chantey rhythms, the cyclical riffage, and any/all of his mystical tendencies. On <em>Fog</em>, Arbouretum does well by both parties.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>When Arbouretum first formed, in 2002, they offered dusty, dimly-lit folk rock that suggested a less mysterious Califone-- muffled drums, Appalachian finger-picking, tape hiss, dark intimations in the lyrics. As time wore on, their sound sprouted psych-rock fuzz, which has since spread like kudzu to overtake everything. On <em>The Gathering</em>, their fourth full-length, there is precious little evidence of their former shimmering acoustic beauty. The only signal that we are dealing with the same group comes from their undimmed, aching sincerity. This quality that once led them to burden an otherwise lovely song with the lumpen title &quot;People Flock Not to the Good&quot; now\u00a0has lead singer Dave Heumann delivering brutal lines like these from a Jimmy Webb cover, &quot;I was a highwayman/ Along the coach roads I did ride,&quot; with a straight face. This stiffness wasn't a problem as long as their music provided nuance and shading. On <em>The Gathering</em>, though, the sonic vista is flattened out, resulting in a dreary, grayscale trudge of an album.</p>\n<p>It's a shame, because Arbouretum show signs that they could be a great desert-rock band if they loosened up. The churning Foghat riffs on opener &quot;The White Bird&quot; evoke the right time period and headspace, and the pleasantly noodling guitar solos induce the proper middle-distance head-nod. Heumann's voice, traveling somewhere between Jim James' &quot;Bermuda Highway&quot; and Scott Weiland's &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot;, enters high and hearty in the mix, and the song cruises weightlessly along its proscribed path for seven minutes. Everything is, momentarily, in its right place.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, things quickly plummet off a cliff from there. The fuzz-rock trance Arbouretum are aiming to induce needs groove to sustain it; groove, in turn, demands flexibility. And, well, you don't get much more rigidly inflexible of an on-record presence than Dave Heumann is here. With his strident vocals and leaden phrasing, he lends all the swagger [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| of a Calvinist preacher to the proceedings, and the effect is like Kryptonite to the groove. &quot;There is a righteous band that's marching/ They're beating drums and even speaking in tongues/ They're passing plates along/ Clothed in garments of the sun,&quot; he quavers on &quot;Destroying to Save&quot;. Time and time again, he hits his point so squarely on the nose that it hurts-- I know they're called Arbouretum and all, but did he <em>really</em> need to sing &quot;Let's go inside the forest?&quot;</p>\n<p>Sincerity, by itself, is no musical sin. But it makes a pretty egregious mismatch to the music Arbouretum have found themselves making. Queens of the Stone Age, masters of the bleary desert-rock form, found the perfect mantra to complement their sun-baked throb on &quot;Walking on Sidewalks&quot;; &quot;I wish we could get away/ Drink wine and screw.&quot; Sloganeering over this stuff just produces headaches and squinting. No one likes to be hectored when they're trying to bliss out. Arbouretum were once a very good folk-rock outfit; they might want to consider calming down, or unplugging.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Of the eight tracks on Arbouretum's second album and first for Thrill Jockey, 2007's <em>Rites of Uncovering</em> , only four finished their damaged, crunchy, soul-blues sighs in less than four minutes. The others barreled beyond the five, seven, eight, and 11-minute marks, respectively, all powered by the spiraling guitar solos of Dave Heumann. At <em>Rites of Uncovering</em> 's best, Heumann sounded like indie rock's new guitar idol, unpredictably dodging strict meter, melody, and form. Like Jerry Garcia circa 1972, Heumann crested the rhythm section, pulling his outfit through thundering rock and scorching noise. The band was plenty good, you know, except the show belonged to <em>this guy</em> .</p>\n<p>But of the eight tracks on Arbouretum's third album, <em>Song of the Pearl</em> , only one breaks the six-minute mark (and barely so). What's left of Heumann's guitar heroics have largely been folded into the songs-beneath or between the verses-or truncated so that they no longer comprise the album's apex. <em>Song of the Pearl</em> feels more like the work of a seasoned rock band that's experimenting with textures like strings and piano while focusing the songs with conventional restraints. Thing is, before <em>Song</em> , this quartet only recorded three tracks as a band. On <em>Kale</em>, the band's 2008 split with labelmates Pontiak, the unit's workmanlike stability gave Heumann's ideas room to roam. The promise of those tracks goes largely unfulfilled on <em>Song</em> .</p>\n<p>Arbouretum becomes less of a trio supporting Heumann and more of a quartet featuring Heumann here. The move doesn't play to Arbouretum's strengths, meaning that-at worst-this hits like a &quot;jam band&quot; flatlining through a proper studio session. Like <em>Rites</em> , <em>Song of the Pearl</em> is alternately driving or drifting, anxious or languid. The extremes are less compelling, though, and the bulk of the record feels too staid to be effective. The first four tracks float right by, the band plodding through opener &quot;False Spring&quot; and &quot;Another Hiding Place&quot;. The title track trots in and out at mid-tempo, strings rising swiftly between each line. It's an awkward stumbling block for the song's sidewinding motion, and it leaves little of an impression.</p>\n<p>The second side is a bit more aggressive, at least, from the italicized beat and strident electric tone of opener &quot;Thin Dominion&quot; to the multiple spiraling guitar passes that sprint in every direction during &quot;Infinite Corridors&quot;. Closer &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot; is Arbouretum's best slow number yet, a smoldering reflection for a guitar with strings that sound as if they've been gathering rust for an eon, played through an amplifier sutured with string and scotch tape. Heumann's voice acts just as beleaguered, barely able to wash past the damage.</p>\n<p>Change often hinges on trade-offs, and Arbouretum's shift from the rangy dynamism of <em>Rites</em> to the stunted kinetics of <em>Song of the Pearl</em> is no different: Though he leads us less with his guitar, Heumann's words are sharper now. On <em>Rites</em> , he felt like a formal poet, filling his verse with forced end-rhymes that reflected allegiance to rules, not song. Heumann relaxes here instead, taking the rhymes when they come but not overreaching.</p>\n<p><em>Song</em> 's more considered writing is the record's real payoff. As the band rages through &quot;The Midnight Cry&quot;, the story of 19th century New England priest William Miller's failed apocalyptic prophecy, Heumann relies on repetition and redundant rhymes to differentiate the verses-- a smart strategy that binds the cascading narrative. On the other hand, Heumann's anxious imagery during &quot;The Fall Line&quot;-- the collapse of the sun, the evil eyes of wolves, the peering watchman of the moon-- tumbles down without rhyme, meaning our narrator has more pressing worries than propriety.</p>\n<p>Perhaps praising Heumann's improved writing plays like faint praise, but it's as significant a step in the <em>right</em> direction as tightening the instrumental belt is in the <em>wrong</em> direction. That it took just two years and one album to do both reflects Heumann's ability and desire to take this band anywhere. Movement, after all, made those old guitar solos glorious. You've got to think that, even after this net setback, Arbouretum's best work remains in its future.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>From the first hollowed-out chords and reverbed vocals of Arbouretum's second album, <em>Rites of Uncovering</em>, it's clear that it's going to be a somber, serious record. Bandleader Dave Heumann cites the writings of Paul Bowles, where sheltered Americans violently confront their naivet\u00e9 in hostile foreign lands, as the album's primary influence, so you know off the bat it's not going to be a barrel of laughs. Throughout the first couple of songs, the jury stays out on whether it's to be just serious or <em>overly</em> serious: &quot;Signposts and Instruments&quot; and &quot;Tonight's a Jewel&quot; display all the stylistic tics that some listeners, myself included, will have to work a little to get past.</p>\n<p>Before the quality of the songwriting, you'll notice the presentation: All of the dragging percussion, mincing vocal inflections, peyote-friendly guitar dirges, and portentous lyrics allude to a certain shamanistic fetish. One occasionally pictures Heumann showing up at the recording sessions with a stack of Neil Young records stashed beneath a scratchy poncho: A city slicker attempting to channel the fiery-eyed desert mystic of folklore with wiggy guitar slides, Big Sky psychedelic atmosphere, aloofly metaphysical imagery, and waves of heat-stroke fuzz.</p>\n<p>But over the course of the record, the resonance of the melodies gradually overrides the initially distracting phrasing, revealing a sometimes exquisite folk-rock album. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that two of the most striking songs are the ones where Heumann unburdens his voice of rococo intonations, letting it ring high and clear through the music: &quot;Mohammed's Hex and Bounty&quot; profits from the same blend of humble guitar work and hangdog, prairie-broad singing that distinguished Flying Canyon's record last year (although Heumann sings on key), and Heumann exhales elegant concentric circles into the star-rippled surface of &quot;Two Moons&quot;.</p>\n<p>&quot;Two Moons&quot; is also one of the only songs here that doesn't feature anything resembling a guitar solo, bringing the album to a serene close. As someone who tends to mistrust guitars whenever they get too obviously into being <em>guitary</em>, it's rare for me to be impressed by solos. But the ones on <em>Rites of Uncovering</em> are impressive indeed, to the point where our own Grayson Currin was compelled to spend his entire &quot;Pale Rider Blues&quot; track review diagramming the one it contains.</p>\n<p>My problem with guitar solos in general is that they're often like tattoos-- something showy inscribed upon the music's skin. Arbouretum's are sinewy connective tissues so deeply embedded in the music's viscera that they hardly qualify as solos. Time and again, they reinforce, instead of derail, the momentum of their songs.</p>\n<p>This group effort, written in conjunction with a full band, improves upon the Heumann-penned debut by disregarding its instrumentals and lo-fi inclinations, emphasizing fluidity and polish. It retains the <em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em>'s vast desert ambiance, but renders it in tremblingly lucid tones that are more stylistically appropriate than the debut's gauzy imprecision. If you occasionally get the uneasy sense that you're being led through the desert on a horse with no name, that's ultimately part of the album's allure: its ability to skirt the edges of grandiose clich\u00e9, sometimes slipping halfway down the slope, while packing a cowboy-sized wallop into each slow-mo, afterimage-trailing haymaker.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>From Ned Oldham's Box Tree Records imprint comes Arbouretum, a recording project by his brother Will's erstwhile backing guitarist Dave Heumann. Since the <em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> was created, Arbouretum have developed into a touring band with a full roster; they're recording a group album now. But this record is primarily the work of Heumann and drummer David Bergander, and the skimpy lineup contributes to its clarity of vision and lucid specificity. The record rings with the quiet purity of a pin dropped on tile, locating its force in translucence and strategic omission.</p>\n<p><em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> is rather unusually divided into two distinct songwriting styles-- austere yet richly detailed instrumentals and majestic, lo-fi indie folk anthems. The demarcation is clear: Heumann doesn't allow the two modes to blur together; he deliberately counterpoises one against the other in precarious, hypnotic equilibrium. The most striking antecedent is Dave Pajo's Papa M project, particularly the instrumental/lyrical dichotomy and mirage-like shimmer of <em>Whatever, Mortal</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> immediately sets about conjuring the wilderness it wearily traverses with &quot;Sands and Sands&quot;, with its intermittent cascades of clattering percussion, the ebb and flow of slithering arpeggios, and distant chimes. On &quot;I Am a Somnambulist&quot;, a baroque acoustic guitar figure morphs into a ramshackle dirge of shuffling electric guitar and patchwork strings, as if a DJ were crossfading Six Organs of Admittance into Califone. &quot;Early Bird Gets the Worm&quot; changes gears, collapsing the other instrumentals' spacious atmospheres into linear articulations of forward momentum, with its clicking drums, rigid wire of guitar, lyrical bass line, and squealing electric leads.</p>\n<p>The savage blankness of the instrumentals is tempered by vocal tracks that ascend like beacons, their brightness amplified by the murky distances between them. &quot;Sands Upon Sands&quot; bleeds into &quot;Jonas Got a Tooth&quot;, a (smog)gy four-track epic that unveils Heumann's matter-of-fact baritone-- it's a long crescendo described via muted, incremental shifts in intensity and rhythm. &quot;Don't Let It Show&quot; is a staticky, coasting lament that seems always on the verge of grinding to a halt-- like melancholic moans drizzling over a plodding folk ballad. And on &quot;All That Has Come Isn't Gone&quot;, Heumann parades up and down his range, his voice cracking and stretching through crisply enunciated vocal glissandos. Profiting from the tension between these two modes, <em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> is a startlingly fine (if discomfortingly barren) expanse of windswept aridity, a haunted and piercingly simple desert music limned in stark silhouettes and sepia tones.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Archie Bronson Outfit's last album,\u00a0<em>Derdang Derdang</em>, had a winning way with a tired genre, divesting psychedelic garage rock of all but its essentials: swaggering grooves, stabbing riffs, and gouging pop hooks. Aesthetic differences aside, songs like &quot;Dart for My Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; were almost Spoon-like in their economy. And while ABO singer/guitarist Sam Windett's voice isn't conventionally pretty, he conveyed a rare emotional intensity, even danger.\u00a0<em>Derdang</em>'s timing, however, was unfortunate. Ahead of any garage rock revival, the 2006 LP dovetailed with the rise and UK chart triumph of Arctic Monkeys.</p>\n<p>No surprise then that, four years later, the bearded trio's copping a different sound-- one that includes synthesizers, dance beats, and Tim Goldsworthy's production work. Lame bandwagon-jumping? Actually, no. Former DFA-co-honcho Goldsworthy didn't stamp his dance-punk signature on every one of\u00a0<em>Coconut</em>\u2019s tracks, but the ones he did are uniformly ace. On first single &quot;Shark's Teeth&quot;, ABO's buzzsawing guitars and punk instincts are preserved, but leavened with Hercules &amp; Love Affair-style disco nostalgia. &quot;Hoola&quot;'s another peak, its cooing female backups flirting with Windett's strangulated yelp in a swirl of beats and hooks. Two psychedelic rave-ups on the record's first half, &quot;Magnetic Warrior&quot; and &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;,\u00a0offer both delirious drone and expert popcraft.</p>\n<p>But\u00a0<em>Coconut</em> stumbles midway through with &quot;You Have a Right to a Mountain Life/One Up on Yourself&quot;. A title like that's a tip-off, and the song is indeed a malodorous heap of bellowing reverb, guitar noodling, and dire lyrics like &quot;Eat your heart out/ It's yours to eat.&quot; &quot;Mountain&quot; is only four minutes long, but feels like 40. However, it may be preferable to the several cuts that follow. With little of their predecessors' electro-pop sparkle or psychedelic fireworks, but plodding rhythms and vanilla-flavored melodies to spare, tracks like &quot;Bite It &amp; Believe It&quot; and &quot;Hunt You Down&quot; kill any momentum the album had generated.</p>\n<p>In fact, the whole second half of\u00a0<em>Coconut</em> would be a wash if it weren't for finale &quot;Run Gospel Singer&quot;, in which Windett assumes a favorite role as maiden-tempting-Mephistopheles. &quot;You're a gospel singer and I am a seller of songs&quot; he wheezes over swishy tambourines and Arp Cleveland's headlonged kick drums. The track's rough and rushed, but also sexy and spontaneous, leaving you wishing the album offered more like it. So, yes,\u00a0<em>Coconut</em> seems to be a &quot;transition album&quot;: A sometimes-exhilarating, sometimes-WTF layover between a possibly played-out formula and exciting new sounds on the horizon.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Some say love and hate are made of the same stuff. And when Sam Windett pleads, &quot;Lose your hate, it's a game/ Come on love me, it's your fate&quot; on &quot;Dart for My Sweetheart&quot;, you can hear him navigating the terrain between the two. Not once on <em>Derdang Derdang</em>, the second album from London-based Archie Bronson Outfit, does he sing a whimsical melody or even deliver his vocals with authoritative confidence. Instead, his voice quivers with uncertainty and howls with murderous desperation. And it fits with the album's principal conceit, spelled out in its first track, when Windett stammers: &quot;It's so fun to love someone/ But try, try to get, get over it.&quot;</p>\n<p>As a sentiment, it's hardly new for pop music-- heartbroken souls driven to kill are as old as the blues. Appropriately, ABO take the majority of their musical cues from the blues-- as well as 1960s garage rock. But the band avoids the trappings of its influences and builds something new out of age-old sources. Taken individually, no part of an ABO song dazzles. In lieu of flashy solos or virtuoso playing, the tasteful and understated instrumental elements form a dark and brooding whole. And there's almost never a flooring shift or change, just determined marches that pick up volume and intensity without swerving from their relentlessly steady tempos.</p>\n<p>On &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, the band lays down a foundation of Mo Tucker-ish toms and snare and a repeated acoustic guitar phrase. But as Windett continues his lovelorn death wishes, threatening, &quot;I'd bury myself to hold you, darling,&quot; a bevy of elements turn it into something much less skeletal. A sustained, whistling guitar calls, bird-like, and a chorus of backup singers parrot it back in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; doo doo doos. &quot;Rituals&quot;, the album's most frantic number, is more dynamic. As the drums move from withdrawn military-style rolls to frenetic gallops, Windett abandons a mournful wail for primal hooting. Fueled by a skronky <em>Fun House</em> saxophone, the song speeds up into a dizzying series of abrupt stops and starts with Windett's screams punctuating the gaps. It would have been the perfect ending to an already unsettling record, but ABO tacked on an anemic acoustic rendition of &quot;Dart for My Sweetheart&quot;, re-titled &quot;Harp for My Sweetheart&quot;, that serves only to spoil the album's claustrophobic atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Outside of the closer, there's an impressive coherence on <em>Derdang Derdang</em>, showing how well ABO has developed an original and guiding aesthetic. But like the narrow thematic scope of Windett's lovesick wailing, such a restricted musical palette means that many of the songs blend together. To a degree, this sense of overlap seems intentional: Lyrics are recycled and nearly all the songs feature wordless refrains, with melodies as simple and memorable as nursery rhymes. So even if Windett never reconciles his contradictory impulses in the lyrics, ABO's obsessively hermetic approach to songwriting makes for a focused and assured statement.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Since releasing his first single as Zoo Kid in 2010, the Londoner Archy Marshall has treated his creative output like loose change spilled into couch cushions. He's released hip-hop mixtapes, ambient instrumentals, and remixes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-FwVcdqCx4\">other acts' songs</a>; only some of his output has been under the name <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/\">King Krule</a>, the moniker he settled on for his 2013 debut full-length, meaning it's flown beneath the radar of casual music fans who were stunned by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18414-6-feet-beneath-the-moon/\"><em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em></a>. The work of tracking what he does now has fallen to hardcore faithful, which seems like a smart long-term survival strategy and a sensible reaction to early career hype: halve your visibility, double your productivity, and wait for the universe to catch up.</p>\n<p><em>A New Place 2 Drown</em> is a\u00a0name given to three new projects\u2014there is also a handsome 208-page art book of sketches, photographs, and poetry from Marshall alongside his older brother Jack, and a short film. And then there is this album. All of it surfaced together this week, and the shared title seems to make an offer to fans and clarify a wish to the larger world. Marshall wants to be swallowed by his work, and he's offering you a chance to join him.</p>\n<p>Marshall has often seemed eager for disappearance\u2014journalists have dubbed him &quot;press-shy,&quot; a euphemism for &quot;loathes journalists&quot;\u2014but on <em>A New Place 2 Drown</em>, he achieves it completely. His voice was the star of <em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em>, a blood-red streak against black, but here he dissolves it into the grey mist of his beats. Mostly he croons or mutters over crackles, drips, and clanks.\u00a0He is an element in his landscape now, not a spotlit singer-songwriter or an ersatz modern-day blues singer. There isn't a single guitar audible on the album's drifting, dreamlike 37 minutes, and not a single song you could imagine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiesQcy6jzI\">Willow Smith attempting to cover</a>.</p>\n<p>What it shares with his older work is the septic world it depicts, full of flickering halogen bulbs, sticky synth keys, and corroded outputs. He's made tremendous strides as a producer, to the point where his touch exceeds Rodaidh McDonald's work on his debut. His sound is more three-dimensional, a series of shrouded corners and murmured conversations. This is wandering, grey-skies music, finding pleasure and even sensuality in solitude.</p>\n<p>Like most others in the sentient universe, Marshall is a professed fan of hardcore '90s NYC hip-hop, stuff like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/\">Wu-Tang</a> and D.I.T.C. Unlike everyone else, he gorgeously reproduces its gloom and loneliness, and finds a way to integrate it into his own style. He does this mostly with a succession of sounds so obsessively perfect and tactile they seem like whole songs themselves: The hollow, rounded <em>thunk</em> of the drum track on &quot;The Sea Liner MK 1&quot; precisely mimics the sound of colliding pool balls, and hearing it for only a measly four minutes seems like a cheat, somehow: It is a drum knock so perfect you would cross the street to listen to it.</p>\n<p>The formal grain of his music bends increasingly towards hip-hop: The sluggish tempo and tar-thick synths of &quot;Dull Boys&quot; and &quot;Thames Water&quot; suggest across-the-pond admiration of Houston's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/24062-dj-screw/\">DJ Screw</a>, as does the halting sing-song of &quot;Buffed Sky&quot;. His mumbly, string-of-conscious delivery on &quot;Sex With Nobody&quot; conjures early-'00s indie rappers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti/\">Serengeti</a> or <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/160-atmosphere/\">Atmosphere</a>. He is steadily narrowing the gap between the rap he admires and the music he makes, and <em>A New Place 2 Drown</em> seems like evidence that he should start producing for rappers regularly.</p>\n<p>Marshall's own words are haunting but elusive, ripples moving across the surface of his music that dissipate before your ear focuses on their meaning. But you get a peek into a mind state and a mood with every legible phrase: &quot;I'm pretty sure I'm dying as I speak,&quot; he offers on &quot;Arise Dear Brother&quot;. &quot;She plays me Barry White, all night/ She drift into the light,&quot; he sings wistfully on &quot;Ammi Ammi&quot;. The most ringing line, clearest in both its setting and its intention, comes from &quot;Buffed Sky&quot;:\u00a0&quot;I'll fly solo,&quot; he sings, drawing out the second syllable of the last word for relish and emphasis. It seems like it's working for him.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The only thing that could prevent you from exposure to music from Arling and Cameron's third album, <em>We Are A&amp;C;</em>, would be packing your bags and moving to the moon. Trust me. Even if you never step into a record shop, you will fall victim to the duo's precisely organized obnoxiousness. No boutique, no mall, no gas station pump, no sports arena, no roadhouse will be unmolested by the dismal facile jollity that Arling and Cameron concoct. Allow me to illustrate this with an indisputable fact, which has been verified by several U.N. agencies as well as ASCAP.</p>\n<p>The first broadcast on post-Taliban Afghan radio was a Pashtun-language ad for Old Navy performance fleeces, backed by an Arling and Cameron song. D'oh! After six years of no music, no television and no relief from militia-enforced beard itch, most Afghanis naturally welcomed such a spritely, happy ditty. But the people of the free world have a solemn duty to tell our recently liberated brothers and citizens that music can be more than just a mind-erasing jingle.</p>\n<p>Is it going too far to state that Arling and Cameron are terrorists, hell-bent on the banalization of music? Probably. But just in case the Dutch duo plan to wreak hideous destruction, I'm duty-bound to advise you all in the severest terms that if you suspect you or those you care for are being exposed to Arling and Cameron:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cover your ears.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leave the establishment that is host to these pernicious melodies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inform your local F.B.I. office without delay.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that I've outlined the procedures, I should probably run down what you're likely to encounter. I will illustrate what you're to be alert for with reference to tracks from their latest and most heinous collection, <em>We Are A&amp;C;</em>.</p>\n<p>Arling and Cameron take Kraftwerk's <em>Autobahn</em> into lushly harmonized surf-pop on &quot;5th Dimension.&quot; Amid all the blips, beeps, and swirls, the pair blithely chant, &quot;The man machine is on a roll/ Getting closer to our goal/ Total freedom of the soul.&quot; &quot;B.B. Electro&quot; blasts its horns, ready for a fun-car commercial. When another GM-affiliated manufacturer releases its latest VW Beetle lookalike, there is a 99.5% certainty that &quot;B.B. Electro&quot; will be used as its signature tune.</p>\n<p>On &quot;Up,&quot; a nameless diva shouts for you to &quot;get it up&quot; over Duane Eddy-style twang guitar. &quot;Up&quot; has been mechanized for maximum brain-suck during afternoon rummages through the sale racks at Urban Outfitters. The robotically generated, faux-trip-hop &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; rip-off, &quot;We Are A&amp;C;&quot; blatantly declares that Arling and Cameron are clones. With lines such as, &quot;Two fruits from a musical tree/ We are A&amp;C;,&quot; these guys leave me in little doubt that they're determined to become the Siegfried and Roy of kitsch dance-pop.</p>\n<p>The cod-reggae electro fusion &quot;Coconut Conga&quot; is infectious, like smallpox, while the bouncy Pizzicato Five-goes-lightly-jungle &quot;Can You Pah-Pah?&quot; will arouse the passion of a thousand post-irony hipsters who will moan into their Campari and sodas that this dreck hasn't yet been issued on 8-track. &quot;Born in June&quot; is a tender, hanky-waving diva ballad that even Diane Warren wouldn't have had a hand in. Yup, it's that shit. The professional, Bacharach-y &quot;Sunday&quot; could be the basis for a standout High Llamas song if Arling and Cameron had bothered to add any lyrics beyond &quot;ba-ba-ba-barabaa&quot; and some really arse whistling. Closing with 60 seconds of campy, polka-dotted Le Tigre-isms on &quot;Don't You Fuck,&quot; Arling and Cameron attempt to prove that, though they're terribly good at horsing around, they're not to be messed with.</p>\n<p>At their least offensive, Arling and Cameron are sickeningly self-congratulatory. If, like V/VM or Stock, Hausen and Walkman, the pair's smash-and-grab schtick had any bollocks, I'd be enthusiastic. I'd be mildly turned on if they had Pizzicato Five's panache or Bertrand Burgalat's harmonic invention. But <em>We Are A&amp;C;</em> is feckless junk. Handsomely and repeatedly rewarded for being the burglars of pop culture, Arling and Cameron are touting flimsily fashioned sweat-shop counterfeits of far more stylish songs. In other words, <em>We Are A&amp;C;</em> is perfect for in-store play at Old Navy. Consider yourselves forewarned.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In 1975, my father bought an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme that had power windows and an 8-track player. It was the first time I'd ever seen such niceties. I remember that the 8-track deck came with a tape bearing the elegant title <em>Oldsmobile</em>, which compiled songs that were popular on AM radio at the time. There was &quot;The Theme from 'M<em>A</em>S*H,'&quot; a Gordon Lightfoot tune, B.J. Thomas' rendition of &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,&quot; something by Earth, Wind and Fire, and, I believe, a track by Dionne Warwick. My memories of styling in that gas-guzzling Cutlass, listening to that <em>Oldsmobile</em> comp, are some of my earliest and best. I'd kill for a copy of that 8-track now, just to hear those tunes laid out in order. Of course, it'd be impossible to track down something so obscure. But now, thanks to Arling and Cameron, I don't have to.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> that <em>Oldsmobile</em> tape, remade by a couple of Dutch clowns in their own image. It veers from late 60's cabaret to disco to easy listening to lounge-- a retro blend which admittedly is not very original at this stage in the game. But through a combination of Arling and Cameron's sharp studio skills, their sure feel for genre, and most importantly, an unfailing sense of humor, these two manage, somehow, to make the zillionth such retro LP sound fun and cool.</p>\n<p>Though Arling and Cameron are a duo, they bring an army of collaborators into the studio, from crack session musicians to singers of every stylistic and linguistic stripe. &quot;Le Flit Et La Fillie&quot; opens the album with a Continental go-go theme, &quot;W.E.E.K.E.N.D.&quot; is a hilarious (and impressively accurate) homage to easy listening, with a man and a woman harmonizing on the virtues of each day of the week (and spelling out the chorus in a goofy Dutch accent). &quot;Hashi&quot; is a spy theme tribute to a drug-sniffing canine, another witty cut that includes echoing dog barks in a parody of dub style. &quot;Let's Get Together&quot; is a spot-on blend of house and disco that could've been recorded in 1980 if the engineers of yesteryear had a studio setup this sophisticated.</p>\n<p>And so it goes for the 14 remarkably consistent but, naturally, far from groundbreaking songs on this strong collection; <em>Music for Imaginary Films</em> is retro music with tasteful modern flourishes and a good sense of fun. Now all I need is to track down a '70 Cutlass...</p>\n",

My heart is huge, knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly English guys with a sampler. Speaking of which... techno music.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, there was Meat Beat Manifesto. Don't get me wrong-- there still is a Meat Beat Manifesto, but in the early '90s it was the only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around. <em>Storm the Studio</em> and <em>99%</em> are sheer works of genius. I rediscovered this last week when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles. There I sat in front of the stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on &quot;Tekken 3.&quot; Hard beats, so thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out at any moment. Have you heard these albums? If not, snatch them up. They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the early '90s.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track. Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under 120 BPM. Everything's too fast to dance to. Sorry if it dates me, but it's true. I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at 900 BPM to jungle music. Arling and Cameron's latest in a string of American releases, <em>All-In</em>, has a handful of tracks like this but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive. Even on the track &quot;We Love Dancing,&quot; the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip. Remember &quot;Milkman&quot; from Aphex's <em>Richard D. James Album</em>? Who didn't bust a gut during the crazy &quot;I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits&quot; chorus? Deaf people, of course. Everybody else got the joke. &quot;We Love Dancing&quot; is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling four- year- olds singing the title and yelling &quot;Yaaaaaaaay!&quot; The joke is later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody &quot;We Love to Rock&quot; and the spacy &quot;We Love Dub.&quot;</p>\n<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that <em>All-In</em> is, yet isn't, a techno album. &quot;Speeding Down the Highway-- Fastest Girl Around&quot; is a nice merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the godawful hijinx of the Cardigans. &quot;But What About the Boys&quot; is a future gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics won't entail Ace of Base or Human League. &quot;Get It On&quot; rubs itself all over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and Hammond organ. The sprightly fun of &quot;Groovy&quot; will have you tapping your foot and whistling in no time flat. Can you dance to it? Ask a dancer. I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like <em>All-In</em>.</p>\n",

It's a gorgeously perfect disco-fluff diamond, a lighter-than-air swoop through pop history, a mindless scream of ecstacy, and it ended up at number two on my singles ballot last year. Too bad it's the only good song on <em>Nympho</em>, Armand Van Helden's disco-punk move.</p>\n<p>If this seems like a step-behind attempt at blatant trend-humping (which it is), it's also not entirely a bad idea; why shouldn't a top house producer be able to do this shit right? But no. Van Helden's idea of disco-punk consists of layering crunching overproduced metal guitar over weak little basslines and dinky cowbells, then hiring someone to gurgle meaningless sexed-up bullshit over the top. Four of <em>Nympho's 13 songs are collaborations with Virgin Killer whose rawked-up Rapture-biting yawp is unbelievably tiresome and obnoxious. On &quot;Come Play with Me&quot;, a ridiculously fake-sexy Cr\\x8Fme Blush coos about falling in love with a DJ and doesn't even come close to selling ridiculous lines like &quot;He broke my heart in a limousine/ I was tired of the scene.&quot; Even &quot;Jenny&quot;, Van Helden's second collaboration with &quot;Hear My Name&quot; vocalists Spalding Rockwell, is a sad attempt at rocking out, the singers pathetically failing at getting all gothy and snarley over a turgid metallic bassline. When people are making fun of coked-out NYC hipsters, this is what they're talking about.</em></p>\n<p>When Van Helden comes up with a decent idea, he runs it into the ground hard. The first time he lays a cheesed-out 70s rock vocal sample over chugging house drums, it's mildly sweeping and glamorous. By the fourth time, it's clear that he doesn't have any more tricks to pull out. And by the time we get to the final track of the album, where Tim Holden says a bunch of echoey poetry-slam stuff over a lumbering, ungainly riff for six and a half minutes, it's clear that &quot;Hear My Name&quot; deserved a much better album.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The homeless lady who sits outside the yuppie coffee bar on the corner of my street assures passers-by that the end is coming. I think she's desperate to convey her message. Though the United States is saber-rattling with the People's Republic of China, it seems that everyone has overcome their millennial tension, and the eve of destruction has turned to a morning of devil-may-care optimism.</p>\n<p>Collectively, we're overjoyed that, without much effort or awareness, we kicked the Beast's ass. The Beast, as prophesied by some locust-muncher out in the Negev Desert thousands of years ago, was supposed to arrive last year and annihilate us before being mightily smote by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I missed this. Living as I do in America's capital, the seat of iniquity and corruption, I should have had ring-side seats to the most righteous beatdown of all time. I even missed witnessing the Rapture, the faithful's assumption to the right hand of God that was suppose to occur just before Satan's saurian shredded all of creation.</p>\n<p>The homeless lady implores those who walk by to believe. &quot;You've not gotten away with your godless existence,&quot; she seems to be saying, as she sits surrounded by two shopping carts and two decades' worth of daily newspapers. She never gets ranty or violent, and by and large, is on the presentable side of destitution. This way, one doesn't feel sullied when approaching her personal space to drop a dollar into her plastic cup. She always tells you you're blessed by Our Redeemer and wishes you a beautiful day. Nonetheless, she tirelessly reminds everyone that the end is coming.</p>\n<p>She's right, of course. At some future point, by virtue of the inescapable effects of entropy, the universe will collapse in on itself and unimaginable havoc will ensue. But that's about a trillion years into the future, so I'm not going to let that distant apocalypse disturb me too much. However, the homeless lady's admonitions do remind me that, though I won't likely be around to fall victim to the utter destruction of time and space-- the reducing of everything to an infinitely small and massive energy blip-- some things around me now are evanescent, transitory, limited.</p>\n<p>These evanescent, transitory, limited things are the stuff of poetry. They're the familiar beauty of Dante's <em>Beatrice</em>, the redeeming orchestral tuttis in the third movement of Saint-Saens' <em>Organ Symphony</em>, the consummate swish of Ted Nugent's cat tail. To this incomplete list, we must now add several moments from Arovane's <em>Tides</em>.</p>\n<p>After his Pole-ish remix of Various Artists' &quot;No. 8&quot; and his Autechre-indebted debut, <em>Atol Scrap</em>, I was ready for Uwe Zahn (aka Arovane) to express himself rather than pay homage to his IDM heroes. And instead of drawing inspiration from the insides of his iMac or the boom-bip sounds of yesterday's tomorrow, Zahn dug the sea. Yup, a trip to the French coast fired Zahn up to combine ambient undulations of a vaguely Vini Reilly guitar with ebbing and flowing beats. After the harpsichordian trills of &quot;Theme,&quot; the title track focuses on the subject of Zahn's meticulous study. And study he has.</p>\n<p>These brief tracks need no remixing or extending for club action; they're far from being the background to bong hits. Their encapsulation of the hypnotic motion of water and the uniqueness of each wave marks Arovane out as unquestionably in the same small class of self-assured and talented musicians as Boards of Canada and Jake Mandell.</p>\n<p>&quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; is a windchime melody surrounded by cicada strings and the almost imperceptible hum of moth wings. It gives way to the Bill Frisell-like impressionist guitar lines of &quot;Seaside.&quot; &quot;The Storm&quot; begins as another harpsichord etude before torrential rain pours down in the form of pounding-as-John Bonham beats. Zahn returns to tranquility with &quot;Deauville,&quot; enhanced by oddly graceful squarks of seagulls gliding overhead.</p>\n<p>Zahn has resisted the temptation to describe in glitch minimalism the hydrodymanics of solar and lunar influences on our oceans. And surprisingly, <em>Tides</em> is not an amateur attempt at eco-journalism (Zahn's seashore isn't littered with garbage and melanoma-hungry humans)-- it's an artist's impression of an earthly paradise.</p>\n<p>The prominence Zahn gives to the harpsichord through this album exemplifies the deliberate, contemplative unrealism he wishes to communicate; he's taking a sound commonly associated with Baroque parlors and betwixt-minuet trysts, and attempting to reprogram our associations. And while I can't say that I've been wholly won over by this aspect of <em>Tides</em>, I have been-- and continue to be-- astounded by the rare reflective grace of the music. So let the end come. Satan's stormtrooper will destroy me, never less than charmed by the ceaseless undulation of <em>Tides</em>. I can conceive of far worse ways to go.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4343-tussle/\">Tussle</a>'s music frequently resembled electro-funk-as-astronaut ice cream: dehydrated, alkaline, functional but in an abstemious way. As Arp, ex-member Alexis Georgopoulos has retained his old group's basis in krautrock and modular synthesis but has taken it in freer directions, relaxing out of Tussle's parched technicality across a string of increasingly warm, woolly and hard to categorize records. As Arp's first two efforts form a symmetrical pair, so does new EP\u00a0<em>Pulsars e Quasars</em>\u00a0with last year's improbable <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18528-arp-more/\"><em>More</em></a>.</p>\n<p>On the 2007 debut\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11353-in-light/\"><em>In Light</em></a>, Arp drifted serenely among cold stars, turning to the ethereal side of Tussle's beat-driven German electronic idiom. Then, he touched down on some clement sunset shore with the grainy, glowing 2010 effort\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14606-the-soft-wave/\"><em>The Soft Wave</em></a>, hooking into the neo-new-age trend of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=\"v\">Emeralds</a> with minimal arpeggio suites. (Seldom has a musician's alias been so on-the-nose as Arp's: It's like if <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/\">Tim Hecker</a> called himself &quot;Drone&quot; or <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field\">Axel Willner</a> went by &quot;Loop.&quot;)</p>\n<p>Having dispensed with the nocturnal and diurnal sides of that aesthetic, Arp made a startling but ultimately comprehensible lateral leap to another part of the '70s electronic pop continuum on <em>More</em>, an art-pop album in the style of early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Brian Eno</a>, but more raw-boned and tattered. More omnivorous, too, with sonic touchstones spanning Tin Pan Alley, Motown, '60s garage rock, and '70s glam, all polished to one brassy consistency and decoratively etched with analog electronics.</p>\n<p>Following the impeccable abstraction of its predecessor, <em>More</em>'s prominent adenoidal vocals and live instrumentation took some getting used to before you could even hear it as the same artist. But there was a sense of continuity in the hushed crackle of analog signals, sealing in the garish songs. If it had come first, <em>Pulsars e Quasars</em>, a more evenly balanced between electronic instrumentals and vocal-led songs, would have made for a less abrupt transition.</p>\n<p><em>Pulsars</em> feels looser and livelier than\u00a0<em>More</em>, using a pickup band rather than solo multi-tracking. On the title track, a jaunty guitar line, phased slightly green and nauseous, supports a stuffy vocal. After starting simply, the guitars gain definition and start to churn, with waves of distortion like impalpable explosions in the background, toward a cheering cherry sunburst finish. &quot;UHF1&quot; similarly begins in a metronomic place before the guitar phases start swooshing and crumpling in the far corners, pumping in a chaotic energy that cues mutations into dance-rock and heroic noise; in both songs, the instrumental melody is stickier than the faintly droll vocal intoning.</p>\n<p>Though the psych-pop songs stand out, the instrumental electronic side of Arp, which gets two fine showings here, is arguably preferable. On &quot;Chromatiques II (Extended Mix)&quot;, an elegant decanter of delicate periodic tones gorgeously fills and drains with morning light. Its many voices grow freer and freer, like a starchy choir gradually easing into gospel expression. Meanwhile, &quot;New Persuasion (Version by Le R\u00e9v\u00e9lateur)&quot; is a precise and detailed krautrock voyage, with low arpeggios tensed as if about to strike, a lurking bass like footsteps coming up behind you and a synth melody that wafts out like silver smoke on the dark.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of weak spots on this EP: &quot;Suns&quot; is attention-getting as a blown-out noise intro but is not a piece you'd return to on its own, and \u201cOn Returning\u201d, built on a loop of thickly chugging electric guitar chords, presses onward like a huge, mindless drill. It's pretty boring and one-note, but if Georgopoulos' indulgent, decadent tendencies produce the occasional dud, it seems a small price to pay for the intrigue of looking forward to what he\u2019s going to do next.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's been a while since Alexis Georgopoulos worked under his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28087-arp/\">Arp</a> moniker, leaving three years trailing in the wake of his last full-length album, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14606-the-soft-wave/\"><em>The Soft Wave</em></a>. He's worked in art and modern dance in the interim, but Georgopoulos has clearly spent some time thinking about how to retool this project as well. <em>The Soft Wave</em> was all balmy synth textures and endlessly repeating figures, sometimes lightly prickled by waves of bass and distorted guitar. Georgopoulos found his voice toward the close of that record, forgoing his mostly instrumental work to deliver a pitch-perfect pastiche of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/\">Brian Eno</a>'s 70s vocal work on &quot;From a Balcony Overlooking the Sea&quot;. Surprisingly, it's a thread he picks at for the bulk of <em>MORE</em>, settling into a more song-oriented incarnation of Arp that might cause people familiar with his older work to check the package to make sure it's not some other band.</p>\n<p>Where Georgopoulos has landed is somewhere in-between various strains of the British art school tradition, where the mundane and the fantastic are equally enthralling. It's part <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/\">Roxy Music</a>\u00a0sci-fi fantasia, part <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/\">Blur</a> down-the-chip-shop scruffiness. Georgopoulos is interested in glamour for sure-- song titles here include <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15813-high-heeled-clouds/\">&quot;High-Heeled Clouds&quot;</a> and &quot;A Tiger in the Hall at Versailles&quot;-- but it's a scruffy, vaudevillian form of it. The sad, clangorous end to &quot;Clouds&quot; feels like a paean to actors who couldn't quite make it, to singers who had a shot at the big time and just fell short. It's heavy on pastiche, but very well done at times. You won't hear a better piece of Eno worship than &quot;Judy Nylon&quot; this year. Even the title is wonderfully Eno-esque. It's too bad Georgopoulos waits until the closing track, &quot;Persuasion&quot;, to get anywhere near the same sense of pop euphoria again.</p>\n<p>So there's a strong sense of someone not reaching particularly hard to get beyond their influences, but even that takes on an appropriate hue as the album progresses. <em>MORE</em> edges into the feel of low-rent theater at times, where the makeup starts to run under the lights, where the performer on stage is revealed to be a fraud. Georgopoulos does a blues track and he calls it <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15626-arp-more-blues/\">&quot;(MORE) BLUES&quot;</a>. He's emptied out pop and found a bunch of dead ends, all circling back in on themselves. Still, this isn't an exercise in the futility of writing this stuff in 2013; it's more like a light, cheerful prod at the parameters of pop. Along the way we get plenty of ambient interludes, hints of Brill Building pop, a dose of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/\">Beatles</a>-y goodness. There's a sense Georgopoulos isn't sure what Arp should be, allowing him to resist being shaped, packaged, and neatly filed away.</p>\n<p>In among all the switching up there's a centerpiece to all of this, if one can exist in such a baffling, un-centered piece, titled &quot;Gravity (For Charlemagne Palestine)&quot;, which is one-part <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/\">Steve Reich</a> repetitive build, one-part <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/\">Spiritualized</a>-style astral gazing. Naturally, going from that to the cheeky end-of-seaside-pier tracks takes some adjusting. But <em>MORE</em> is an album that takes some time to settle in, to really get to grips with all its diverse tendencies. Already it feels like it could become a weightier work over time if Georgopoulos leaves all this behind and moves on elsewhere, causing this album to perpetually spin in its own odd orbit. It's mostly a delight to return to, with its misshapen ways sometimes working toward a bigger picture until Georgopoulos flushes it all down the u-bend via another baffling turn. Here he's got a musical outlet that's not defined at all, and that's a strange and occasionally beautiful thing.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's not like you're going to see Kevin Drumm hitting the Billboard Heatseekers charts or anything, but artists such as Oneohtrix Point Never, Emeralds, Sam Goldberg, Etienne Jaumet, and Gavin Russom have certainly done their part to give arpeggiated drone a higher profile in 2010. This is due mostly to the fact that the music being made is fairly melodic and often pretty-- but it's also disorienting and doesn't always provide the easiest listening experience. There's lots of blissed-out stuff out there, but it's couched in enough static and noise to create a distance between mainstream listeners and the art itself.</p>\n<p><em>The Soft Wave</em>, Alexis Georgopoulos' sophomore effort as Arp, serves to close that gap a little. Arp's 2007 debut, <em>In Light</em>, was a few years ahead of its time in embracing a full-on synth-heavy arpeggio assault, and here he pushes things forward as well, with a record that's the polar opposite of <em>In Light</em>'s smeared, near-psychedelic sound: light and clean, with plenty of negative space. You don't have to find a &quot;way in&quot; to this music; its construction practically leaves a door open for you, with more than enough room to wander around once you're there.</p>\n<p>There's still a fair amount of oscillating drone and trance-inducing patterns here, but their components are more organic than before. While <em>In Light</em> leaned heavily on synthesizers, <em>The Soft Wave</em> noticeably uses more electric guitar and bass, which mixes with the structural void to create an almost three-dimensional texture. Thick-stringed patterns create reverberating foundations throughout, while guitar licks frequently dance lightly in the foreground. The resulting sound is simultaneously fleet-footed and humid, which lends the album a distinctly tropical vibe.</p>\n<p>With more conventional instrumentation comes more straightforward &quot;songs.&quot; Yes, <em>The Soft Wave</em> does open with &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot;, a nine-minute-plus, two-part odyssey filled with jettisoning synth lines and skyward tones, but there's also &quot;From a Balcony Overlooking the Sea&quot;, a stately piece featuring Georgopoulos' warm vocals that recall the more ethereal moments of Brian Eno's &quot;vocal&quot; albums.</p>\n<p>There's a catch, though: just as Oneohtrix Point Never opened this year's stunning <em>Returnal</em> with the ear-shattering, Burning Star Core-recalling noise of &quot;Nil Admirari&quot;, Georgopoulos closes this record out with the uneasy rustling static of &quot;Silver Clouds&quot;. The effect is something of a sonic swarm, akin to black ink leaking over parchment and spreading quickly over its surface. Overwhelming, yes, but beauty needs to be tempered with noise sometimes.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Alexis Georgopoulos, the sole member of Arp, used to be in the instrumental funk outfit Tussle. His former band, who are still going strong, made their name channeling the lean, driving sound of early 1980s New York outfits like Liquid Liquid and ESG; Arp, though a very different animal, is just as heavily indebted to the music of a specific time and place. The most obvious inspiration for this project is West Germany in the first half of the 70s, when the artistically inclined kids born around the time of WWII began to hit their stride creatively. Think early Kraftwerk on Phillips, Cluster, Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream; though each has a hugely varied body of work, all were electronic music pioneers with their eyes and ears trained on the future.</p>\n<p>To Georgopoulos' credit, <em>In Light</em> doesn't come across as a retro exercise so much as an attempt to capture a certain spirit. Titles allude to his forbearers (hard to see a track called &quot;St. Tropez&quot; without thinking of Pink Floyd's 1971 LP <em>Meddle</em>, &quot;Premonition of the Sculptor Steiner&quot; references a Werner Herzog film and, by extension, an accompanying Popol Vuh score) and vintage synths abound, but the overall mood doesn't feel overly tethered to the era. What Georgopoulos capturers most of the age is an approach to sound that made electronics seem warm, friendly, natural, perhaps inevitable, and above all optimistic.</p>\n<p>The post-moonshot days of the early 70s-- like the 50s and the 90s-- were a time when it seemed as though technology might save us yet. <em>In Light</em> reflects a grounded, idealistic mindset; the music is not especially psychedelic, and clarity is prized over drugginess. The percolating &quot;Potentialities&quot; is the spaciest track, its fat, sequenced bass made for either stargazing or a show at the planetarium, but it still has an innocent cast. Even further in this direction is the clean, bright pulse of &quot;St. Tropez&quot;, which brings to mind Raymond Scott trying to engineer the ultimate aural environment in which to raise babies. Only the 15-minute drone piece &quot;Odyssey (For Bas Jan Ader)&quot;, its midrange-heavy synths burred with distortion, flirts with an unsettling atmosphere, but even here it's more a sense of anticipation than dread. All tracks are simple, effective, and easy to grasp, letting a few elements and subtle changes do loads of work.</p>\n<p>Most subtle of all is &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;, which is perhaps the best example of Georgopoulos hearing the music of the past in a fresh way. Sometimes overlooked in discussion of the kosmisch pioneers is that they unwittingly invented new age. These acts weren't above teasing out a pure mood piece, something placid and meditative that was unashamedly in tune with Aquarian-age spirituality. &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;, built with resonant piano clusters that seem to tumble down waterfall-style and a soothing whistle-like tone that brings to mind Florian Schneider's flute, strikes me as sort of brave in its delicacy. It flirts with a sphere of music many consider verboten and then, eventually, Georgopoulos brings through a bassy drone to shake up the calm and give the track some bite. The track's free use of acoustic instruments and familiar textures shows a pragmatic side also in evidence back in the day. Georgopoulos has a very specific vibe in mind for Arp, and he uses whatever works; though a small, simple record on the one hand, <em>In Light</em>, on its own terms, is a big success.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Under the shyly nondescript moniker <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29703-arrange/\">Arrange</a>, Malcom Lacey sets his impulses for abjection and redemption spinning against each other, unleashing turbulent energies. His style of ambient electro-pop hums with quiet urgency, belying its dreamy pace and softly blended pastel tones. This self-therapeutic approach to music might explain Lacey's high yield: This is the third Arrange review I've written in the span of one year. But his productivity is tempered by an uncommon degree of thoughtfulness in the construction of his releases-- he never phones it in. Each record retunes the balance of elusion and revelation. <a href=\"http://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/new-memory\"><em>New Memory</em></a> is the boldest version of Lacey's sound to date, though just by a hair, fitting his track record of growth by dogged increments.</p>\n<p><em>New Memory</em> is consistent with prior albums in its methods of imparting restrained turmoil and distressed beauty. Tenderly pulsing soft synths gravitate toward near-vocal timbres. Their fluent eloquence is a rather ingenious way for Lacey to offset his halting manner of confession and the dignified limp of his rhythm programming. Distant nature sounds flow around the melodies and runaway reverberations engulf them, but sweetening traces of guitar and piano make the drift feel purposeful. In its plentiful transitions, the music gently shreds like tissue underwater and delicately reforms. Lacey deploys his voice judiciously, frequently displacing the emotive peaks onto one of his languid synthesizer solos, etched in the tracks like glowing signatures.</p>\n<p>A cursory listen might divulge more of the same for people without my apparently inexhaustible taste for Arrange. But closely following the project this past year has been like watching a picture develop very slowly, a small figure resolving more clearly in the smear of landscape. On prior records, the singer/songwriter quotient was often buried, almost apologetically, under nocturnal ambiance, if not simply banished to make way for instrumentals of striking emotional clarity. These are still important facets of <em>New Memory</em>, but the reticent aura Lacey holds around his singing and songwriting dissipates considerably. This is particularly affecting to witness from someone whose music so often deals with shame.</p>\n<p>On a purely technical level, Lacey has gotten better at recording himself, capturing fine textures and clear shapes that were sometimes diffused in blown-out distortions on <em>Plantation</em>, though it didn't harm to songs as indelible as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/\">&quot;When'd You Find Me?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://arrange.bandcamp.com/track/tiny-little-boy\">&quot;Tiny Little Boy&quot;</a>. More importantly, the relative exposure of Lacey's lyrics reveals them to be even more unnervingly private and distinctively sung than before. The record's leitmotif is hands, often Lacey's own, which on &quot;Caves&quot; are said to be &quot;porous things/ Filled up by anyfing.&quot; This is an inexplicable accent for a young South Floridian-- who also sings &quot;with&quot; as &quot;wiv&quot;-- but it's strangely appealing. It's like a negative image of Jeff Mangum's voice, the diction deformed by internal pressures, but excessively hushed and clipped rather than loud and elongated.</p>\n<p>Two songs in particular will seem brave or embarrassing according to your temperament, which is why they strike me as brave. After dealing with his relationship with an incarcerated father on <em>Plantation</em>, Lacey directs the denuded benediction &quot;Where I Go at Night&quot; to his mother, pouring his heart out through a clenched jaw. The best part is how pathos turns to delight when the misty piano suddenly leaps into a pertly gated synthesizer, a prime example of Lacey's knack for drawing dark and light into unity. The upbeat conclusion adds rhetorical force to the words of healing. Meanwhile, the title track is a spoken-word performance where we can fully appreciate the natural resonance of Lacey's voice as he exhorts himself &quot;past my own insecurities and rage&quot; to eventually concede, &quot;I can't create a new person/ But I'll create new memories.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1262217745/help-get-arranges-new-mini-lp-new-memory-to-vinyl\">video</a> promoting the successful Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the vinyl edition of <em>New Memory</em>, Lacey spends most of his time self-consciously mugging for the camera rather than brooding in shadow, the stock image that would go with his music. What he has to offer is a particularly unvarnished kind of ingenuousness, quite distinct from the more common and flowery varieties, paired with a sensitive touch for making computer music move in free-feeling currents. He's still not flashy enough to be a buzz band. Instead, and hopefully for a long time to come, he holds an intimate space in a clamorous musical marketplace, with a potentially lethal earnestness that becomes a virtue by dint of his humility and honesty.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>From the remote musical enclave of Fort Lauderdale, the young electronic songwriter Malcom Lacey has posted five <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29703-arrange/\">Arrange</a> albums <a href=\"http://arrange.bandcamp.com/\">on Bandcamp</a> over the past couple of years. High productivity is common among laptop-wielding bedroom auteurs, but Lacey's no data dumper. Each release exhibits unity and care-- its own twist on a rapidly developing sound. The first one I discovered, before anyone knew much about Arrange, was <em>Plantation</em>, which I <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15534-plantation/\">said</a> was &quot;thoroughly a breakup record.&quot; But I was wrong.</p>\n<p>Now that Lacey has done a little press-- such as <a href=\"http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/countygrind/2011/06/qa_arrange_malcom_lacey.php\">this interview</a> with a South Florida weekly-- we know more. His first instrument was the piano; he's more inclined to slave over his ambient textures in private than to play shows in public; he likes <a href=\"http://typerecords.com/\">Type Records</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/\">Perfume Genius</a>. None of this was surprising. But one assertion caught me off guard: &quot;Most of my lyrical content stems itself from an abusive childhood and the relationship I share with my incarcerated father,&quot; with whom <em>Plantation</em> standout <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/\">&quot;When'd You Find Me?&quot;</a> was a &quot;one-way conversation.&quot;</p>\n<p>The revelation casts new light on Lacey's lyrics, which draw opposed qualities-- hostility and tenderness, discretion and confession, self-hatred and self-help-- into uneasy truces. (He'd have fit in well on <a href=\"http://saddle-creek.com/\">Saddle Creek</a> in the early 2000s.) On new EP\u00a0<em>Five Years With the Sun</em>, Lacey is even more furtive than on <em>Plantation</em>, his halting voice washing in and out of audibility, and vanishing for long periods. In hushed tones, he dramatizes the process of a gentle person grappling with dark thoughts-- now scathing, now contrite, lashing out and lashing in. His reticence comes to seem like an impulse for self-erasure, which makes the moments when he overcomes it feel especially poignant.</p>\n<p>Is this palpable struggle what distinguishes Arrange from a thousand similar peers? It certainly isn't the music's substance, a fairly standard amalgamation of synth-pop, shoegaze, ambient, chillwave, and hip-hop. Nor is it any iconoclastic style-- to the contrary, I prize its preternatural patience and humility. And Lacey is already developing a go-to track structure, which has a smoothly churning undercarriage of piano or guitar tones, ranks of juicy synthetic plucks pulsing above, and mechanical drums splashing the edges of the beats; all topped off with a synth lead that flaps like a tattered banner in a sluggish wind.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's something even harder to quantify: that vigilant, moody, quietly rapturous sensibility. While the orders of the day are pleasantly zoned-out or ethereally spiritual, Lacey's music feels almost feverishly alert, with breath-catching pauses and mercurial embellishments calling for close attention to its dreamy flow. Below the <a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/\">Kompakt</a>-isms, one hears the dulcet, revolving intervals of the lullaby. This is music as a ward or charm, its hermetic regularity holding a safe space against chaos. (It was recorded, I'm told, in a walk-in closet.) It doesn't sound like a young man hunting for blog buzz. It sounds like a personal search for redemption, or at least some consolation, one moment at a time.</p>\n<p>Careful sequencing makes <em>Five Years With the Sun</em> feel like an act of tentative revelation through gradual ascent. The immediate pop songs are divided by obscure but quirkily elegant set pieces: &quot;Gone With the Snow&quot;, where bizarrely treated vocals ride over glassy swells; &quot;Airplane Notes&quot;, a study in nocturnal counterpoint. The force gathered on the first half rises to a vertex on &quot;Cure&quot;, a burly production where Lacey opens up his voice with unaccustomed extroversion. &quot;Mt. Rainer&quot; vividly evokes traveling up switchbacks, the winds and vistas bending around, leading us up to the bright, clear peak of closer <a href=\"http://arrange.bandcamp.com/track/sun-showers\">&quot;Sun Showers&quot;</a>, where all the album's fogs dispel.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's a glow/ and I can feel it,&quot; Lacey sings plainly, &quot;deep below the hollow point of me.&quot; A couple of inaudibly murmured lines later, we hear, &quot;the way I felt when I first heard it say\u2026&quot; But the thought goes unfinished. Instead, a long instrumental passage culminates in a weary guitar anthem, then peters out into running waters. He's not the type to make a sound just to fill space; he waits until he knows what he has to say. That's what keeps me hanging on every moment. Enticingly, the open-ended conclusion of <em>Five Years With the Sun</em> promises more striving, more growth, more suffering and deliverance to come.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>&quot;Still can't feel much of anything,&quot; Malcom Lacey sings on &quot;Tearing Up Old Asphalt&quot;, a slow-burner from the South Floridian's first LP as Arrange, <em><a href=\"http://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/plantation\">Plantation</a></em>. With his soft voice awash in electronic hums and next to a tranquil piano line, you can almost believe him. But the claim seems mostly aspirational. His unassuming vocals quiver and crack with emotion, giving the impression not of a person who can't feel, but of one who must be cautious of feeling too much. That's a common symptom of being a teenager, which Lacey is. So it's extra-impressive that <em>Plantation</em> never goes over the top. Instead, this highly personalized fusion of dark indie-pop and laptop ambient taps into volatile wellsprings of longing, resentment, and fear with controlled intensity.</p>\n<p><em>Plantation</em> is very much a bedroom production.\u00a0Often using either a cloud of tone or a simple piano figure as a base, Lacey fashions understated, compact hooks from guitar, vocal loops, and software synthesizers, and then rolls them out for just long enough to lodge them in memory before they vanish. As mentioned in a <a href=\"http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/\">Playlist review</a> of &quot;When'd You Find Me?&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/\">Bright Eyes</a> might wind up with something like <em>Plantation</em> if he judiciously added vocals to a Kompakt <em><a href=\"http://www.pitchfork.com/search/?query=pop+ambient&amp;search_type=standard\">Pop Ambient</a></em> sampler. But Lacey's vision is unique, and makes the album cohesive despite its piecemeal diversity.</p>\n<p>Many different touchstones flow into one retiring mood. Opening instrumental &quot;In Old Theaters&quot; has the stately drive of <a href=\"http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/\">M83</a>. The standout &quot;Tiny Little Boy&quot; nods to R&amp;B with splashy mechanical drums and a soulfully lilting vocal performance. A techno influence becomes more pronounced in the back half: On &quot;Blinds with You&quot;, a droning synth line soars and slumps with weary majesty over crisply staggered drums, and &quot;Veins&quot; owes an unabashed debt to <a href=\"http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/\">the Field</a>'s slithering pulses. The blurry melodies of chillwave, the drafty space of dubstep, and the hypnotic repetitions of classical minimalism are all contextual influences. But everything blends into a unified voice thanks to Lacey's knack for thoughtful connective tissue and striking lyrical point of view.</p>\n<p>This is thoroughly a break-up record, but Lacey deals in implication and austerity.\u00a0His perspective has a mature balance: He makes accusations that cut both ways, and then he questions them. We get not just the wounded heart and its grudges but the filter of the skeptical mind, watching from a critical distance. *Plantation'*s recording quality is a little uneven, but that seems a small price to pay for the genuine intimacy that can occur when a young person holes up in a bedroom with a computer, a guitar, and his complex sorrow, figuring out on his own what can be made of it all.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>These days, most people only pay attention to the British Top 40 when it's been hijacked by dullards trying to prove a point-- last week it was the battlefield for a protest at the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's increasingly rose-tinted legacy. Yet it still contains a certain romantic allure among those who never stood a chance of getting in it. <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/238-art-brut/\">Art Brut</a>'s new greatest hits collection <em>Top of the Pops</em>\u00a0(a two-disc set featuring a CD of B-sides and demos) is named after the defunct BBC TV rundown of the nation's favourite songs, an obsession of their ever-enthusiastic frontman Eddie Argos on which they never appeared. In typically shambolic fashion, they've only gone and forgotten to include their actual song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO3OUjLNSMI\">&quot;Top of the Pops&quot;</a>, an early and live favourite that was always prefaced by a gleeful string of fibs about where the south London band were number one.</p>\n<p>Presciently named after the French for &quot;outsider art,&quot; Art Brut always shot just wide of the mark; had they been around 10 years earlier, they'd undoubtedly have been a fixture of the ITV network's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DE27DF7A9AEC318\">&quot;Chart Show Indie Chart&quot;</a>-- an earnest rival to &quot;TOTP&quot; that broadcast videos by bands like the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4564-the-wedding-present/\">Wedding Present</a> (who released two singles volumes called <em>Hit Parade</em>) on Saturday mornings-- if not genuine Britpop bona fides. In a Pitchfork <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/35010-5-10-15-20-art-bruts-eddie-argos/\">interview</a> from 2009, Argos recalled seeing a copy of <em>NME</em> that asked, &quot;Who's the new <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/\">Jarvis Cocker</a>?&quot; &quot;I thought, 'Fucking hell, some prick I bet.' And I opened it up and it was me. I was like, 'Oh fuck! Well, that's nice.&quot;</p>\n<p>Just as British indie music was getting smart again after a fallow few years either side of the millennium, Art Brut's demeanor embraced indie's coziest, most cardigan-wearing past; Argos standing against all prevailing trends, trying to recreate the world of his youth. But their 2005 debut <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/475-bang-bang-rock-roll/\">Bang Bang Rock &amp;\u00a0Roll</a></em> was\u00a0a near perfect, shabbily anthemic post-punk record that set out Argos' abundantly hilarious lyrical stock in trade: singing about how his relationships with music and ladies were as close as the &quot;n&quot; in &quot;snog&quot; and &quot;song&quot;.</p>\n<p>In among the declarations of romantic haplessness (<a href=\"http://www.vevo.com/watch/art-brut/good-weekend-live/AUN861100221?source=instantsearch\">&quot;I've seen her naked <em>twice</em>!&quot;</a>) was a rampant self-mythologizing streak so overstated it was as if Art Brut knew they could only ever fail, despite being stated with such bounding naivety and joyous conviction that they believed it would all come true. If only; Argos' benign, brilliant, <a href=\"http://cobweb.businesscollaborator.com/hmhb/\">Half Man Half Biscuit</a>-indebted sense of humor evident on the <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp;\u00a0Roll</em> singles included here is something painfully lacking among young British indie bands today.</p>\n<p>Art Brut were arguably obsessed with restoring a culture over individual success, which is lucky since their highest charting single went in like a bullet at number 41. Although one memorable scene in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; sees resident indie nut Lane Kim <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVq_tPQN9fU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">swear</a> that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qryAwfpHG8o\">&quot;Formed a Band&quot;</a> should be the national anthem, Art Brut abjectly failed at bringing back the time Argos craved, or slowing the path of an increasingly compromised alternative music culture to the mainstream. But having committed themselves to failure after establishing such lofty goals in the first place, you'd think it wouldn't matter to them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at least in the narrative that\u00a0<em>Top of the Pops</em> spins,\u00a0everything that followed <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em> did so with increasingly unbecoming shades of bitterness. They'd have been better off reissuing <em>Bang Bang</em> for a second time than opting to tell this glum take on events.\u00a0The songs included here from 2007's EMI-released\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10336-its-a-bit-complicated/\"><em>It's a Bit Complicated</em></a> (where Jasper Future replaced Chris Chinchilla on guitar) wonder &quot;what else can we do when the kids don't like it?&quot; Argos experiments with and ultimately muddles his personal narratives, and when he wearily yells &quot;punk rock ist nicht tot!&quot; it sounds like the delusional cry of a man bent over punk's dying corpse; not the words of the bloke who once joyously belted, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP6nY-112Xc\">&quot;MODERN ART! MAKES ME! WANT TO ROCK OUT!&quot;</a></p>\n<p>The malaise increases with 2009's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12902-art-brut-vs-satan/\"><em>Art Brut vs. Satan</em></a> (a return to Cooking Vinyl/Downtown), produced by <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/381-frank-black/\">Frank Black</a>, where Argos sings of his arrested development, unruly drinking problems, and shit summer jobs. He also now hates all the idiots that just can't appreciate good music: &quot;If we can't change the world/ Let's at least get the charts right/ How can you sleep at night/ When nobody likes the music we write?/ Record-buying public, we hate them/ This is Art Brut vs. Satan,&quot; goes &quot;Demons Out!&quot;, where the band start to sound like the tiresomely dogmatic <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/958-the-cribs/\">Cribs</a>. The Wakefield band's 2005 single &quot;Hey Scenesters!&quot; was a disdainful comment on the emergence of indie culture that Art Brut ran around celebrating like lunatics on &quot;Formed a Band&quot;. Here, the distance between them shrinks depressingly.</p>\n<p>The returns don't stop diminishing: Also produced by Frank Black, 2011's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15417-brilliant-tragic/\"><em>Brilliant! Tragic!</em></a>'s &quot;Axl Rose&quot; sees Argos reduced to a cantankerous cipher: &quot;The world is fucked, and you're an idiot/ Why don't you take a long look at my middle digit!&quot; He makes hapless attempts at singing in a sinister whisper that suggests a stalker ogling his unwitting intented; the band are as convincingly vigorous as someone trying to pogo on a belly full of Sunday roast.</p>\n<p>Two new numbers close CD1: &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; is named for a Bill Hicks album where he fantasized about L.A. falling &quot;in the fucking ocean&quot;, thus destroying the fantasy explored in\u00a0<em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em>'s &quot;Moving to L.A.&quot; Here, Argos is in the middle of an earthquake situation that reads like a less-than-subtle take on the band's dwindling career. Closer &quot;We Make Pop Music&quot; is\u00a0the only song on <em>Top of the Pops</em>' main disc that hits a musically regretful note, playing out with an almost-epic middle-eight over which Argos desperately yells, &quot;We make pop music! We make <em>pop music</em>!&quot; (Though in a recent blogpost, Argos <a href=\"http://www.lofipunkrockmotherfucker.co.uk/post/29611690472/what-happened-to-having-musical-genres-people\">wrote</a>, &quot;I only like guitar music and everybody who disagrees with me is a cunt.&quot;)</p>\n<p>With the release of <em>Top of the Pops</em>,\u00a0Argos keeps insisting that Art Brut were a &quot;classic rock&quot; band all along, offering the fact that they've been on the cover of German <em>Rolling Stone</em> and posed naked in the <em>NME</em> as proof. In a sense (though not the one intended), he's right: <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em> was an accidentally classic album that gave Art Brut an immediate legacy that they seemed to know they'd never top-- a fate that befalls classic rock bands obsessed with besting their best and blaming the rest rather than engaging with the culture around them.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>All right, whose brilliant (i.e., tragic) idea was it for Eddie Argos to start singing? Was it producer Frank Black? Argos himself? Jasper &quot;the Dolphin&quot; Future? Did anybody actually think the problem with Art Brut was all the talking? I rather thought that was like the whole point. Granted, you either love the talking-singing thing or you hate it (see also: the Hold Steady), but at least it was their <em>thing</em>. And beyond being totally, instantly recognizable, it wasn't all that bad of a look for Art Brut, either: Argos' witty, conversational lyrics were always well served by his spoken delivery, offset by the band's playfully slick rock session band chops. But now Argos has gone from ranting about halting a make-out session to turn up a pop song, to singing (scarcely), &quot;I want to be played in the background while couples drink their wine/ That would be a triumph with a voice like mine/ Everybody wants to feel sexy sometimes/ I can make it happen with a voice like mine.&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, at least he hasn't lost his wry sense of humor. But about this newfound singing business: Argos has discovered a voice that sounds a bit like Jarvis Cocker's, only if he'd lost it after a long night out drinking-- a little hoarse, whispering low so as not to upset the hangover. So the album opens with what might as well be its mission statement, &quot;Clever Clever Jazz&quot;, a typically dry-humored song about a band punching above its weight: &quot;Sorry that it doesn't sound like it's planned... can't you see we're doing the best that we can?&quot; Next is another entry into the band's &quot;Weekend&quot; trilogy (now extended, Douglas Adams-like, to four songs if you count B-side &quot;Really Bad Weekend&quot;), &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;, and while it's as clever and sweet as any of its predecessors, Argos' intonation doesn't exactly do it any extra favors.</p>\n<p>Some songs work fine with the singing: The above-quoted ballad &quot;Sexy Sometimes&quot; succeeds by dint of making Argos' very struggle the subject of its gently plodding fun, as does &quot;Is Dog Eared&quot; to some degree. And then halfway through the album, it seems like even Argos has started to think all this is a bad idea, reverting back for the remainder to his old patterns of speech and shouting.</p>\n<p>The results are, unsurprisingly, some of the album's strongest songs, largely because Argos just gets out of the way of his own lyrics. &quot;Martin Kemp Welch Five A-Side Football Rules!&quot; is a scorcher, covering the familiar Art Brut territories of football and unrequited schoolboy crushes. &quot;Axel Rose&quot; raucously praises its subject as being the sort of guy you'd want in your corner when giving the world the finger. Maybe best of this side is &quot;Sealand&quot;, ending the album on a drifting note, a dream of starting a sovereign nation of two at sea that affectingly flips the motto of <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em> standout &quot;People in Love&quot;: &quot;People in love lie around and get fat/ I didn't want us to end up like that.&quot;</p>\n<p>In all this talk about talking, the band Argos originally hired through an ad in the back pages of the <em>NME</em> gets short shrift. But trust that they still sound very much like a band hired from the back pages of the <em>NME</em>: competent rock hands with equal flair for squealing guitar solos and pop backing vocals, easy showmen but not exactly showy. Basically, they punch their weight, and they do it quite well-- sorry to say, but their frontman-turned-singer might want to follow their example.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Spoiler alert: Art Brut lose. Of course they do. Tramps like former Art Brut tourmates Hold Steady were born to run around wearing baseball jerseys in front of Counting Crows fans (and good for them!). Art Brut were born to lose: How could they ever improve on the clumsy meta-punk rush of their first single, &quot;Formed a Band&quot;? They arrived almost fully formed. They never got to play &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. When they miraculously came up with another 11 songs just about as good-- or, in the case of &quot;Emily Kane&quot;, arguably better-- on their brilliant 2005 debut album, <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em>, it only added sting to their inevitable defeat. They were even losers at being losers. I loved them for it.</p>\n<p>That's partly why it's so strange now to read reviews that lump Art Brut in with more commercially successful UK bands such as Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand. At live shows, lead not-quite-singer Eddie Argos used to change &quot;I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground&quot; to &quot;I can't stand the sound of Gang of Four,&quot; and I always assumed his targets were obvious (hint: neither the Velvet Underground nor Gang of Four). Full of fist-pumping but self-mocking bar-punk about obsessive fandom and romantic awkwardness, <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em> was the closest our decade has come to <em>The Modern Lovers</em>. Art Brut's true peers are lyrical music geeks like John Darnielle, Jeffrey Lewis, Jens Lekman, Los Campesinos!, the Tough Alliance, and, most recently, Nodzzz. It's not irony; it's self-aware sincerity.</p>\n<p>Good news for people who love losers: Art Brut's third album is on what Kanye might call &quot;some Benjamin Buttons shit.&quot; Gone is the slight maturation of their good-- but, sadly, not great-- sophomore album, 2007's <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em>, which tried to win by the attractive-people rules of polished production; the songs were still warm, witty, and alive, but they just didn't have the original's &quot;I've seen her naked-- TWICE!&quot; brashness. Recorded on the fly with fellow Jonathan Richman acolyte Frank Black, <em>Art Brut vs. Satan</em> is a scrappy, romantic, and painfully hilarious return to loserdom. Coldplay will always be more popular. So what? I hate those guys!</p>\n<p>Art Brut probably do, too. If they can't topple vague, pasty, barely breathing background rock from the charts, at least they can sing gloriously doomed songs about it. &quot;Cool your warm jets, Brian Eno,&quot; Argos jibes on &quot;Slap Dash for No Cash&quot;, teasing shiny U2 clones the way he previously skewered vapid post-punk revivalists. Argos champions instead the records where you can hear not only the crack of the singer's voice, or the squeak of the guitarist's fingers, but also (as on a Gorky's Zygotic Mynci B-side, apparently) their parents complaining about the volume-- not because those records are more artistically valid, or more authentic or whatever, but for a more important reason: &quot;Those are the records I <em>like</em>.&quot;</p>\n<p>Black gets the Art Brut spirit down on record better than anyone has before, with the blazing pop-metal vainglory of Weezer, the scruffy cheekiness of early Rough Trade bands, and lots of enthusiastic backing vocals. Fun for them, fun for us. &quot;Demons Out!&quot; shifts the Smiths' &quot;Panic!&quot; from hanging DJs to denying record buyers suffrage, but don't mistake it for a Death Cab for Cutie-like manifesto against U.S. Auto-Tune pop; more accurately, it's an ideal rebuke against the endless Travis Kooks Kaiser Chiefs Razorlight blandness of UK &quot;science museum&quot; rock. So too &quot;The Replacements&quot;, which melds the Mats' &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; and the Brut's &quot;My Little Brother&quot; into a clamorous endorsement of used CDs and deluxe reissues. Extending the prior album's trend toward sacrilegious song titles, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; may not have you accidentally repeating its off-key la-la-las in public, like the song's narrator, but you'll probably know exactly how he feels. Not that Satan gives a damn about songs that communicate aspects of everyday life with clarity and human charm.</p>\n<p>Art Brut remain ever the underdog when they're singing about arrested development and girls, too. &quot;DC Comics and Chocolate Milkshake&quot; is a cereal-eaters' song as universal as Jerry Seinfeld, with a nicely echoing bridge, while perfectly sloppy public-transportation anthem &quot;The Passenger&quot; rewrites Iggy Pop from the perspective of a guy who can't drive. &quot;Summer Job&quot;, with its Vampire Weekend-whooping intro vocal, is the album's only concession to conventional melody, and its summertime-blues-curing slackerdom could hardly be more enjoyably juvenile. Like a bizarro &quot;Rusted Guns of Milan&quot;, &quot;What a Rush&quot; fumbles for morning-after Beatles vs. Stones meaning-- and socks. Add to vocab: &quot;Sober...<em>ish</em>?&quot;. Slowing down but not going ballad, &quot;Am I Normal?&quot; is a preview of the kind of shy neurotic who might go on to write &quot;Emily Kane&quot;.</p>\n<p><em>Art Brut Vs. Satan</em> begins and ends with a hungover Argos trying to remember what he did the night before. Frantically buzzing opener &quot;Alcoholics Unanimous&quot; finds Argos sending apologetic mass texts; he's been concerned about what he's been up to, and with good reason. On epic finale &quot;Mysterious Bruises&quot;, which I didn't even notice was seven minutes until I looked it up later, Argos proclaims: &quot;I fought the floor and the floor won.&quot; Satan always wins. The beautiful people and their sycophants will always outnumber lovable losers. But this is a record I <em>like</em>.</p>\n",

For a group who made their entrance with the autobiographical origin story &quot;Formed a Band&quot;, the pledge that &quot;it's not irony, it's not rock'n'roll,&quot; and a humble and brash sound meant more to buttress singer Eddie Argos' wry observations than draw attention, landmines for a &quot;mature&quot; follow-up are everywhere. Change the lyrical approach to sober up the honest and clever self-indulgence, and you forfeit the angle that makes Art Brut unique and lovable. Pretty up the music too much, and you distract from and compromise Argos' regular-dude frontman bit. Merely remake <em>Bang Bang Rock N' Roll</em>, and risk the accusation that the band's concept was only good for one 30-minute shot, sentencing the group to the cult-band one-and-done footnotes. No wonder the second album is called <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps aware of this foreboding obstacle course, Art Brut have wisely managed to somehow make all of these mistakes and none of them, incrementally expanding their sonic palette while Argos evinces a slightly more grown-up perspective, yet never straying too far from the band's original M.O. Sure, there's a more muscular lead-guitar on most tracks here, they've discovered the joys of audible backing vocals, and a horn section even turns up on &quot;Late Sunday Evening&quot;, but there aren't any ill-advised dalliances with laptop beats or orchestration or even, god forbid, ballads. Meanwhile, Argos' muse has perceptibly changed from &quot;gee-golly, I'm in a band!&quot; and bedroom performance anxiety to domestic living and the simple joy of music-listening without blunting his wit or giving in to the temptation to talk about fame and touring.</p>\n<p>The subtle shift is apparent from the very start, as &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; hangs on a lead riff and an almost-solo more upfront than anything on <em>Bang Bang</em>, albeit far too slowly played to register as overly flashy. Meanwhile, the vocal is classic Argos, amplifying the dilemma of mid-makeout radio adjustment to epic proportions, interrupting a kiss to tentatively ask &quot;have you heard this song before?&quot; Sexxing is, in fact, on Argos' mind throughout the record, from the courtship drama of &quot;Direct Hit&quot; to stay-in-bed-baby pleadings of &quot;Blame It on the Trains&quot;. &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; is even the polar opposite of the last record's slightly uncomfortable impotence trilogy, finding the singer pleading with his sleepy girlfriend to stay up and frolic while torturing himself with paranoia about her exes.</p>\n<p>But more effective than these romantic ruminations are the tracks where Art Brut switches up their meta-aware music-about-music tendencies for the better, progressing from songs about making songs to songs about the irresistible urge to build a soundtrack to one's own life. In a way, &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; fits this category as well; if nothing else, it's about wanting to enhance an already, er, stimulating experience with the proper audio accompaniment. &quot;Sound of Summer&quot; is even more direct, fetishizing the process of creating the perfect mixtape in painstaking detail, right down to breaking the tabs &quot;so you can't tape over it ever.&quot; The zenith of this subject is clearly reached on &quot;Nag Nag Nag Nag&quot;, the band's between-albums single that amps up the central riff and sun-bleached backing vocals to make the song's dead-on coming-of-age headphones drama properly triumphant.</p>\n<p>The upgrades in production values aren't always an improvement, however, as it occasionally comes at the sacrifice of the band's scrupulous spontaneity. Argos' self-aware humor is still present-- pronouncing &quot;here comes the really good bit!&quot; in the breakdown of &quot;Direct Hit&quot; or apologizing for his Germ-glish (&quot;punk rock is nicht tot&quot;) in &quot;St. Pauli&quot;-- but doesn't produce as many banner-waving one-liners. Moments like &quot;People in Love&quot; and &quot;Post Soothing Out&quot; are more demure than anything found on the group's debut, and embellishments like the horn breakdown of &quot;Late Sunday Evening&quot; are a poor substitute for the homegrown fist-pump peaks of older tracks like &quot;Emily Kane&quot; and &quot;Modern Art&quot;.</p>\n<p>These missteps are testament to Art Brut's hidden element: the band itself. While Argos draws the spotlight of most reviews (this one included), the rest of the band quietly adds its own crucial element, which at its best is a simple, raucous sound perfect for underscoring melodramatic tales of sex and rock. As &quot;St. Pauli&quot; nervously reflects, Art Brut are at heart a throwback punk band-- albeit one with a frontman that is far more charming, thoughtful, and witty than your typical three-chord bashers-- and two albums down, they're already bumping up against the constraints of that genre. By only gently nudging the musical formula on <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em>, Art Brut have succeeded in crafting a satisfying half-mature sequel, but may have only delayed, rather than thwarted, the sophomore jinx.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><strong>WE'RE JUST TALKING... TO THE KIDS!</strong></p>\n<p>When you start to measure the amount of music you listen to in gigabytes and jumbo-size Case Logics, it's easy to forget the awesome power of the simple declarative statement. Nothing against all those 30-piece ensembles, nautically focused concept albums, intricate field-recording pastiches, and three-hour drum circles that dominate our musical neighborhood, but sometimes it's refreshing to hear a band maximally juicing a single sentiment down to two-minute concentrate. Meet South London's Art Brut: They're here to fill that vacancy.</p>\n<p><strong>I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, <em>TWICE</em>! I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, <em>TWICE</em>!</strong></p>\n<p>That it's difficult for me to find a recent point of reference for Art Brut is a testament to just how self-serious indie rock has become-- although they do share a refreshingly bratty quality with proto-punks like the Buzzcocks and Television Personalities. Frontman Eddie Argos even appears to share Joey Ramone's love for first-person narratives that sound no more complex than a transcript of just-some-guy's thoughts on a completely unremarkable day. Ruminations on ex-girlfriends, new girlfriends, little brothers, modern art, his band, other bands, Italian currency, Los Angeles-- all are expressed in language too shallow for even diary-scrawling, but lifted up to anthemic status through sheer multiple exclamation-point enthusiasm.</p>\n<p><strong>I CAN'T STAND THE SOUND OF THE... VELVET UNDERGROUND!</strong></p>\n<p>Oh my God, heresy! But of course, it's only half-serious, a joking reminder to today's bands that VU ended up writing (gasp!) unabashedly fun songs like &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;What Goes On&quot;, too. If these sloppy, succinct three-chord bashers fail to tread any ground that isn't already well-worn, they do so in an appealing way that underscores Argos' oscillations between humility and delusions of grandeur. Art Brut might display more versatility than one-tempo Ramones, but not by much, contenting themselves with fast songs (&quot;18,000 Lira&quot;, &quot;Bad Weekend&quot;) or slow songs (&quot;Rusted Guns of Milan&quot;, &quot;Stand Down&quot;). It's just enough to give these minutiae-obsessed songs their paradoxical fist-pumping grandeur, and not a bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>NO MORE SONGS ABOUT SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK N' ROLL... IT'S BOOOOOORING!</strong></p>\n<p>That this line comes amidst the album's most straight-ahead rock number-- and that about 90% of Argos' lyrics discuss these very topics-- is probably the best joke on the album, though it's not wanting for humorous company. The sly origin story &quot;Formed a Band&quot; and art-fetish celebration &quot;Modern Art&quot; (both re-recorded here from their 2004 single versions) may have laid the foundation of Art Brut's blog rep, but <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em>'s new material is equally hilarious when it aspires to be. Argos paints the perfect picture of musical awakening in &quot;My Little Brother&quot;, the subject of which expresses his frustration through mixtapes of &quot;bootlegs and B-sides,&quot; and makes &quot;Emily Kane&quot; more than just a casual remembrance of young love by being able to recollect the last time he saw her, right down to the second. It's tempting to think of Art Brut as the foreign replacement for the catchy/clever observances Weezer used to traffic, the escape fantasy of &quot;Moving to L.A.&quot; obliterating the clich\u00e9s of &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, with its shirtless motorcycling, hanging with Axl and Morrissey, and foolish tattoos.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVEN'T READ THE <em>NME</em> IN SO LONG... DON'T KNOW WHAT GENRE WE BELONG!</strong></p>\n<p>Well, let me try to help. See if you can follow this: Art Brut, through their thoroughly unpretentious embrace of pretentiousness, are the most punk new band I've heard in years, punk having lost itself long ago to the pretentiousness of unpretentiousness. So even though Argos boasts of wanting to &quot;write the song/ That makes Israel and Palestine get along,&quot; and planning to perform Art Brut's hit eight weeks in a row on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, any chance you might take him seriously is deflated by the little meta-moments like the one caps-locked above. As with the best LCD Soundsystem singles, <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em> is at times some of the best music criticism going right now, and far better than our boringly verbose bullshit 'cause you can dance to it.</p>\n<p><strong>AND ART BRUT, WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED!</strong></p>\n<p>The optimism of that statement is infectious and hard to argue with, though I'm perfectly aware of the large pile of empty Brit-hype firecrackers that went off with a barely a whimper Stateside. Given their reliance on dry English humour (yes, two u's) and lack of a timely U.S. distribution deal, it's unlikely Art Brut will fare well as well with North American listeners as fellow countrymen Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads. But then, just a year ago, it seemed unlikely that any of <em>those</em> bands would find fans in the States at all, let alone enough to spark yet another small-scale British invasion-- and all told, it's not hard to imagine their dagger-sharp guitar lines and pop-fueled bash carving its own niche in those other bands' wake if given the opportunity. The only thing to do is start a letter-writing campaign, suffer the import prices, and hope Art Brut's got enough in their tank for another album or two. I can't wait to hear &quot;Recorded a Sophomore Album!&quot;</p>\n<p></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>&quot;What do you think about at night?&quot; the anonymous narrator of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4183-john-tejada/\">John Tejada</a>'s electro-house anthem &quot;Sweat (on the Walls)&quot; asked dancefloors eight or so years ago. She already seemed to know the answer: House, with its sensuous rhythmic patterns and lustrous textures, is commonly described as a music of feel, of thoughtless submission, but even in the moment of seduction the dancer can watch him or herself getting lost in the music, observe, and perhaps feels a bit uneasy at their easy sacrifice of a bit of their humanity in the name of communal hedonism. Perhaps this sense of double-awareness is what the music itself thinks about at night: you can hear it in A Tale of Us' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsamh1b764\">remix</a> of Fuckpony's &quot;Bongo Porn&quot;, the swirling delirium and compulsive jerking of the original ushered through unexpected minor-key passages of sadness, regret, even existential crisis, as if the groove is forever pivoting on that point where pornography might turn, almost imperceptibly, into a scene from Steve McQueen's <em>Shame</em>.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Bongo Porn&quot; remix lays bare most brutally the vibe which Canadian house duo <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29353-art-department/\">Art Department</a> stalk on this DJ mix, their first for their record label No. 19 Music's flagship series, and an unashamed extension of the sounds and emotions they explored on their 2011 album <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15361-the-drawing-board/\"><em>The Drawing Board</em></a>. If, for the most part, <em>Social Experiment 003</em> scales slightly lesser heights than the peaks reached on their debut (the epic &quot;Vampire Nightclub&quot;, the by turns creepy and bittersweet &quot;ICU&quot;), it also avoids that record's tendency towards heavy-handed overstatement, preferring a &quot;show, don't tell&quot; aesthetic of minor key melodies and densely layered rhythmic patterns (rather than dolorous Ian Curtis vocals) to get across the duo's persistent themes of desire, obsession, self-disgust, and fear of abandonment.</p>\n<p>The resulting sound feels neither modern nor particularly retro, although it's certainly arguable that the music's buffed up, high-gloss late night classicism resembles just a bit too strongly the kind of music that, say, Poker Flat label boss Steve Bug was playing nine years ago. Criticisms along these lines are true enough as far as they go, and Art Department will never win any awards for bravely conquering uncharted territory, but it would be unjust to ignore the dedication with which the duo strive to form a solid aesthetic around house's ambivalent hidden narrative of the dissolution of the self, going right back to Robert Owens' harrowing Chicago house classic &quot;Bring Down the Walls&quot;. Fittingly (if somewhat obviously so) Owens offers guest vocals on two of the highlights here, starting with Art Department's own remix of Luca C. and Brigante's &quot;Tomorrow Can Wait&quot;, all slithery <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/\">Depeche Mode</a> synth arpeggios and ceaseless house percussion over which Owens' anti-temporal hedonism emerges more as a quiet moan of dread. Jackin' Rabbit's &quot;Full of Dreams&quot; is even more existentially pregnant, using a bruised-sounding bassline and Owens' hypnotic murmurs to frame house music's escapism as a kind of prison of the mind.</p>\n<p>Appropriately, Art Department's sequencing is patient, frequently letting individual choices spin well past the five minute mark so as to underscore the sensation that these grooves are webs to trap dancers in. This approach works less well on the weaker cuts, where the music seems to simply spin its wheels with a clean-edged and mildly trippy but emotionless panache (see Ali Love's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_lMQoX761g\">remix</a> of Brigante's &quot;The Jungle&quot;, or Art Department, BLUD, and Shaun Reeves' &quot;Robot Heart&quot;), but pays off in spades on the warm but steely tech-house of the two final tracks, Gregorythme's &quot;Artificial Tears&quot; and Art Department's own &quot;Insomniac&quot;, each running for close to eight minutes and offering up their own driving repetition as the only stable reference left in a world lost to doubt and uncertainty. Keep dancing? You've got no other choices left.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Like many dancefloor hits, Art Department's 2010 house anthem &quot;Without You&quot; was a simple idea, simply executed: gloriously uncomplicated snapping house percussion and a bassline that sounds like a sinking feeling, while over the top a ghastly corpse of a vocal (via member Kenny Glasgow) intones dully, &quot;I don't know what to do without you/ I just can't make it without you.&quot; Glasgow sounds like an obsessive who's lost his grip on reality. Despite the emptiness it was a dancefloor favorite; perhaps dancers recognized its deep well of depression as the necessary flipside to all the good vibes, the dark outline that provides both definition and pathos to endlessly repeated big nights out.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as is often the case when tunes become big off the back of their point of difference, discussions of &quot;Without You&quot; tend to focus on that slightly off-center vocal and the murderous bassline, understating Art Department's impeccable arrangement skills and, in particular, exacting sense of timing.\u00a0Possibly Art Department (a Toronto-based duo of Glasgow and Jonny White) have listened too keenly to their own hype, as their debut album, <em>The Drawing Board</em>, leads off with two long-ass tunes dominated by dolorous basslines and Glasgow's morose, out-of-tune vocals. In particular, the aptly titled 10-minute-plus opener &quot;Much Too Much&quot; gambles that a miserablist refusal of excitement and intensity or, you know, something happening, will end up seeming evocative and atmospheric rather than half-hearted and aimless. The gamble succeeds only in part: These tracks work, but more in the sense of the listener understanding the concept rather than feeling it in their guts and hearts.</p>\n<p>If you're someone who wants dance music to mean something, then these tracks may be the drawcard here, representing a kind of alternate reality where house vocalists like Robert Owens and Romanthony were more obsessed with the hollowness of Scott Walker's <em>Climate of Hunter</em> than the giddiness of Prince's <em>1999</em>. And it is a great idea, but ultimately Art Department don't strike me as ideas people-- let alone songwriters-- first and foremost. They are, however, consummate arrangers, and <em>The Drawing Board</em> becomes immensely more involving each time the suicide tone poems take a step back and the arrangements a step forward. In terms of sheer groove, the album's easy pinnacle is &quot;What Does It Sound Like?&quot;, whose hypnotic jacking is reminiscent of the debut albums of Motorbass and Fuckpony, each carefully sculpted component interlocking with each other in a satisfying display that Art Department can do mindless release fully as well as pent-up morbidity.</p>\n<p>Three tracks capture the competing tensions at work: &quot;Living the Life&quot;, on which Glasgow sounds unusually tuneful, the epic &quot;Vampire Nightclub&quot;-- which spends about two-thirds of its 10 minutes spiraling through shimmering synth oscillations and vocal samples-- and best of all, closer &quot;ICU&quot;. That final track\u00a0combines a squelching cowbell groove from &quot;Living the Life&quot; with the desperate desirousness of &quot;Without You&quot; to make something bigger and more affecting than either. Like a deep house version of the Smiths' &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;, both melodically and thematically, &quot;ICU&quot; understands that existential voids are always more compelling when kept off-screen, the singer and the listener's attention trained on the mirage of hopeless, obsessive romance. It's an emotional archetype house already knows full well, but rarely has it been articulated so well. Not surprisingly, Art Department are at their lachrymose best not when trying to uncover house's absences, but when redrawing ever more finely what was always already there.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The introductory video on the DVD half of this reissue talks about the legacy of <a href=\"http://www.ztt.com/artists/art_of_noise.html\">the Art of Noise</a>-- mentioning <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/\">Daft Punk</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/\">the Chemical Brothers</a>, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/\">Massive Attack</a>. It's easy to see why the group would be proud of such lustrous descendants, but it actually sells them short. What's interesting about Art of Noise-- certainly the first phase of their project, which culminated in this debut album-- isn't so much their children but their parents. This was a pop band named after a <a href=\"http://120years.net/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html\">1913 art manifesto</a>, deliberately aspiring to inherit the explosion of early 20th century conceptual creativity and make Futurists and Dadaists rub shoulders with b-boys and clubbers. The group's own arch-conceptualist, music writer Paul Morley, apparently planned an album that would be a grand collage of the century's sounds-- what he actually got was an acrimonious split.</p>\n<p>Morley may, in his words, have only &quot;made the tea&quot; in Art of Noise, but he dominates the visual half of this reissue: introducing videos, reading out essays onstage, continually playing the ideas man and provocateur even if his incessant wordplay's an acquired taste. The group's videos are proof that this apparent pretension came with a smart payoff. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCyGdk23KNU\">Beat Box</a>&quot; is recast as the soundtrack to a city with lively, evocative footage of 1980s London cut to its rhythm. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcmIhOesaI\">Moments in Love</a>&quot; mixes dancers and tortoises, grace and absurdity. And most famously &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFK0-lcjGU\">Close (to the Edit)</a>&quot;, the dream-logic realization of the group's ideals, with a creepy punker kid commanding anonymous wreckers as they smash cellos and pianos to pieces.</p>\n<p>&quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot; reminds you that Art of Noise were trying to be funny and sometimes scary-- neither of them standard pop ambitions in 1984 or now. In fact, what's striking about this album is the range of moods and effects it musters, while remaining an intensely playful record. It follows the savage, martial arrangement of Cold War bricolage &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8k4yMOGrUE\">A Time for Fear (Who's Afraid)</a>&quot; with a teasing version of &quot;Beat Box&quot; where the track's purposeful electro keeps getting diverted by shiny new sounds. On the title track, a snooty voice asks, &quot;Can I say something?&quot; and the music refuses to let it even say that, gleefully slashing the sample to ribbons. The album flirts with annoyance and even boredom-- the way the stately, repetitive beauty of &quot;Moments in Love&quot; lulls you before unwinding itself into stranger places. But they could also be thrilling. Their immediate context was hip-hop, but their kind of funk-- best experienced on &quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot;-- has a brash rigor to it, calling to mind tireless pistons and marching feet.</p>\n<p>&quot;This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken,&quot; Luigi Russolo wrote in the manifesto that inspired the band, &quot;and the infinite variety of noise-sound conquered.&quot; But the technological limits to sampling in 1984 meant that Art of Noise were stuck with a very finite variety of noise-sound, constantly worrying at and reusing snippets of samples. The only problem with the many reissues of early Art of Noise is the group's endless recycling of its two key tracks. &quot;Beat Box&quot;-- of which &quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot; is a cousin-- and &quot;Moments in Love&quot; were on their first EP, then issued as separate singles, appeared on every compilation, dominated this debut album, and now appear-- counting the DVD-- six times each on this reissue.</p>\n<p>For diehard fans, the incessant tinkering is part of the fun-- for listeners less caught up in the band's process, it's easy to get a little weary with the radio sessions and alternate video edits collected here. Stick with the core album and videos, though, and you realize the reason Art of Noise kept returning to these songs: Both are superb, anchoring a record that's as sly, stirring, and occasionally infuriating now as it was on release.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Formed in the early 1980s from a collection of studio musicians (notably whiz producer Trevor Horn) and writer Paul Morley that would coalesce into the ZTT label (and give the world Frankie Goes to Hollywood among other delights), the Art of Noise were an instrumental electronic unit wrapped up in a bow of heavy yet cheeky conceptual art. Leaving aside its manifestos and jokes, which are undoubtedly a key part of the band's appeal, these pasty English folks were pioneers of electro, hip-hop, and even Latin freestyle and house. (You'll still catch &quot;Beat Box&quot; on many a U.S. urban station's &quot;Flashback Lunch&quot; hour.) <em>And What Have You Done With My Body God?</em> is a new 4xCD box that takes pages from the group's sketchbook of ideas, with something like more than 40 unreleased tracks.</p>\n<p>The lead instrument in the Art of Noise was the Fairlight CMI, the first digital sampler. You can hit up Wikipedia for much more detailed info, but suffice to say it was an incredibly expensive instrument. In its final version, the 1985 CMI Series III, it went for about \u00a350,000-- all for features that you could get from a $400 yard sale PC today. As a result, it was used mostly by art rockers and big name studio techs and producers. (What's most amazing is that technology was moving so fast that only a few years later digital samplers would be cheap enough to be democratized, leading to hip-hop and dance music's sampling golden era.) Even a casual pop listener might recognize some of AON's tics and noises, the vocal stabs and stuttering hooks it built its name on. (The &quot;hey!&quot; vocal hook off of &quot;Close (To the Edit)&quot; would make the band a little richer when sampled by the Prodigy for &quot;Firestarter&quot;.)</p>\n<p>Already built on sampled drum breaks, ghostly choirs of multi-tracked vocals, and string loops, <em>And What Have You Done</em> sounds like the band never, ever left the studio, pushing a small handful of sampled elements into as many different shapes as it possibly could before it got bored or the money ran out. But despite the mad scientist nature of this creative over-abundance, the Art of Noise's music isn't cold or forbidding or boringly studio hidebound; it can even be lovely. The group's masterpiece, &quot;Moments in Love&quot;, is a 10-minute new age make-out track built on floating motes of voice and shiver-up-the-nape-of-your neck strings, the kind of thing Harold Budd might throw in when it's time to knock boots. It gets three re-workings here-- including the 7&quot; mix on the <em>Into Battle</em> EP-- not counting the tracks that feature just a sound or two plucked from it.</p>\n<p>Much of <em>And What Have You Done</em> barely qualifies as &quot;songs,&quot; just a few minutes of a beat being fucked with-- say, played up and down the octaves of the Fairlight or reversed and put through a filter. (There's also some seriously creepy circus music, experiments for voice, and solos for keyboard.) And some of is just studio fuck-around stuff that no one's life would have been any poorer had it stayed in the vault. But the sketchier tracks sound undeniably like first generation IDM-- the early records of Plaid and Aphex Twin, winsome keyboard melodies over crunchy hip-hop breakbeats-- obviously an important (and unheard until now) bridge between American street-level electro and the bedroom electronic producers of the 90s. As a document of digital creative thrift, four discs of unfinished studio experiments and obsessive self-remixing is amazing and exhausting. And now that computer beats are no longer the strange, alchemical art of pay-no-attention-to-the-man-behind-the-curtain types, we'll never see another band like the Art of Noise, for better or worse.</p>\n",

The divas return and lurk in a booth across the room. John Hurt woos a starstruck flamenco guitarist with his silken, bass- boosted voice.

Rakim suffers a stroke which leaves him able only to repeat the words &quot;Somethin' y'all would compare to Baudelaire&quot; repeatedly. Dudley and Horn attempt to cover for him, distracting those around them by breakdancing. Morley goes off in search of a curry.</p>\n<p>Channels 09-12: Paid programming.</p>\n<p>Channel 13: Dudley and Morley blur the line between ambient and a near- fatal Zoloft overdose. Horn is transported to another dimension, where he hides in a closet from the evil Anti- Horn. The two come face to face and disintegrate in a completely unspectacular fashion.</p>\n",

It's actually very easy to say, and even if it sounds like gibberish to other people, all the better to spin your own mental wheels. Repeat it and start over, and try to see how many times you can do this without missing a number or making a mistake. If you do, start over again. Try to do all of this in a steady rhythm, and with a couple of friends, make a chorus of counting. Then, try to start at the same time but all in different tempos-- keep your own rhythm while the others go off on their own, and then all meet up again on &quot;ichi.&quot; If you mess up, start over again. And again. Then, once more.</p>\n<p>In music, the only culture I know of that employs such complex counting exercises in their traditional music is from India. Philip Glass spoke of studying Indian music before creating his equally mathematical minimalist pieces of the early 70s. Terry Riley also studied Indian classical music, as did La Monte Young. These composers are united by an interest in the disciplined refinement of Indian music, and all applied it to their own idiosyncratic music. Likewise, Asa-Chang &amp; Junray reference Indian music in the process of creating music that is otherwise quite unique. In their case, the idea of rhythm and meter, and the extended development of beat exercises disguised as melodies, seems related to Indian raga. On &quot;Xylophone&quot;, they even bring in sitars to compliment the already dominant tabla and bongo.</p>\n<p>The mini-album <em>Tsu Gi Ne Pu</em> (named for an old Japanese poem) is the fourth release by this duo, and even more than last year's compilation <em>Jun Ray Song Chang</em>, emphasizes how rhythm dominates their music. This almost maddening focus on rhythm dominates every tune on the record, even when, on the surface, it appears that they took a simpler, more song-oriented approach.</p>\n<p>On &quot;Kaikyo&quot;, trumpet and trombone played with subtle apprehension perform a tune that reminds me of the closing credits to a an old Spaghetti Western. However, the actual melody is less brassy fanfare than merely the vocalization of what would otherwise be a drum part, right down to the accented, triplet figures and unison doubling of Asa-Chang's percussion. As it unfolds, the duo plays more aggressively, picks up some speed, and builds upon the simple figures they began with, until they arrive at a one-note endgame. They've gone through every conceivable combination of beats, and end the tune on a sampled crashing of waves. The song is the perfect depiction of obsessive mathematical development (or feverish logic), and will probably annoy as many people as it entertains.</p>\n<p>&quot;Kutsu #3&quot; begins innocently enough with a trumpet and accordion duet, neither of which are playing in any particular rhythm. After their short statement, and a few rising sine tones carried over from the previous album, everything disappears. For better than 10 minutes, there are no sounds at all, until a female narrator begins the countdown reference the opened this review. She counts to twelve, each number representing one note in a chromatic scale, and Asa-Chang and U-Zhaan join in. The never sing the same numbers at the same time, except when meeting up on the first one, instead each enunciating a different pattern with clockwork perfection. For anyone into polyrhythmic fugue, this will doubtlessly be fascinating-- though like most of Asa-Chang and Junray's music, it could have an equally maddening effect on others.</p>\n<p>I'm a little confused as to why the band needed to put that extended moment of silence in there (especially as it takes up about a fourth of the already brief album's run-time), but if a little goes a long way, these two are masters of exotic minimalism. It's going to be interesting to see where they go next; <em>Tsu Gi Ne Pu</em> gives me the feeling it might very well be into uncharted (and impenetrable) rhythmic waters. Like Glass and Riley, they've managed to strike a balance between the obsessive and the charming, and it's still a pretty interesting, if occasionally detached sound.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Melody, harmony and rhythm: at one point, these were three very different (and equally necessary) elements needed to construct music. In the Western World, you'd have to go back a ways to outrun this holy trinity, and even then-- when Chant and minstrels were all the rage-- it was only harmony that lacked the sophistication to warrant equal billing on the musical marquee. Several centuries later, the tables appear to have tilted slightly, as melody and rhythm conspire to overthrow harmony. Some might say we're experiencing a musical revolution.</p>\n<p>And we are, sort of. Truthfully, the marriage of rhythm and melody is an illusion: every melody features rhythm anyway, and always has. In the last 50 years or so, however, music with those &quot;crazy&quot; rhythms has been wreaking havoc on our youth in a way no motet or chanson ever did. I could even show all my cards here, and just jump into hip-hop, where melody and rhythm have been in cahoots so long that, from a distance, it's hard to tell which is even running the show. It's not that either one of these elements is more dominant than the other, but that in the age of beats, riffs and rhymes, it's often unclear what role a particular element is playing.</p>\n<p>Confused? Asa-Chang (originally Koichi Asakura) &amp; Junray (Japanese for &quot;pilgrimage&quot;) cut my muddy thesis to the chase: their &quot;Hana&quot; features a clear, hopelessly melancholy string arrangement-- very much like what Bj\u00f6rk should have been opting for over Hollywood orchestras-- but the most distinctive part of the song is its drastically straightforward marriage of melody and rhythm. Asa-Chang's Indonesian bongo (which sounds remarkably like an Indian tabla) plays in unison to a male/female duet, effectively destroying any expectation for &quot;groove&quot;, yet forming what would be an off-kilter ballad into a futuristic, exotic percussion piece, thanks especially to the band's secret weapons: soft, ascending sine tones. Although technically speaking, all the old building blocks are intact, the harmony is in tune with nothing, the melody has no notes, and the rhythm is present in name only, happy to exist as a melody-by-proxy.</p>\n<p>Asa-Chang &amp; Junray have been performing since 1998, and <em>Jun Ray Song Chang</em> is their first release outside of Japan. It's a compilation of their first two Japanese releases, and is fortunately interesting on more than just technical grounds. The sounds here are unexpectedly diverse (with a band featuring only two percussionists and a programmer, that's a major feat), especially given that each song appears to have been an exercise in making due with only the barest necessities. As mentioned, the melodies tend to be married to the percussion, and while the &quot;Junreitronics&quot; (their very own processing device) apply a small amount of electronic fuckery to the mix, most of this stuff sounds like a natural hybrid of exotic percussion and faux-trad jungle folk, by way of Jakarta, India and Japan. Their sound isn't easily pigeonholed.</p>\n<p>Junray makes use of member U-Zhaan's Calcutta tabla studies on &quot;Nigatsu&quot;, as again, melody and rhythm are mirror images of each other. The opening song-speak soliloquy by Asa-Chang is actually accompanied by a distant rainstorm, and the simple, looped guitar figure acts more as a rhythmic base than as a harmonic center. Asa-Chang runs through several variations on a single rhythm, and when the tabla enters, the entire piece is transformed into a treatise on the roles of rhythm in modern popular music. Yet, in a way, like much of the music on this CD, the arrangements are so sparse that it seems barely there at all. &quot;Kutsu #2&quot; features only a light electronic tapping and simple clarinet duo over its one-minute duration, while the comparatively epic &quot;Jippun&quot; offers little more to flesh out its subliminally addictive strains. This song cuts flute lines, rising sine waves, jumpy synth beeps and rapid-fire tabla to simulate a minimalist, thoroughly modern raga.</p>\n<p>But Asa-Chang &amp; Junray's way of casting ancient instruments in new lights is probably the coolest thing about their music. Where something like &quot;Jippun&quot; or the Chinese festival music of &quot;Goo-Gung-Gung&quot; (apparently, titles get the same minimal treatment) might sound academic-- or worse, smugly conservative-- coming from some Society of Indigenous Music Preservation, here they sound as vital as any modern electronic music, and in many cases, more so. Some of this is indeed due to the way they play with the basic elements in their music, though ultimately, rhythm is at the heart of everything on the album. Beyond theoretical questions, <em>Jun Ray Song Chang</em> poses more pressing ones: if creating new electronic music can sound this fun, why doesn't everyone do it?</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Tehran-via-London artist Ashkan Kooshanejad offers up harsh, detailed compositions that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using physical synthesizers and samplers. Kooshanejad in particular stands out amongst peers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/\">Arca</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/\">Actress</a> because he's not framing his work as a deconstruction of dance music, nor does his knowledge of Persian classical music figure heavily in his work. The digital world, and the software that engenders it\u2014the way it allow users to re-scale, re-orient, and and re-produce sound\u2014is the only apparent framework for Kooshanejad's work.</p>\n<p><em>I AKA I</em> is Kooshanejad's second album under his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/33075-ash-koosha/\">Ash Koosha</a> alias, following last year's <em>GUUD</em>. He's a multimedia artist, dabbling in film as well as expressing an interest in virtual reality. &quot;At some point in my life I thought it was good to specialize, but now I think it\u2019s good to build a bigger product than just music,&quot; he <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9722-ash-koosha-conducting-destruction/\">told Philip Sherburne</a> last year; he's diversified, in other words. But <em>I AKA I</em> is a complex sonic statement, one where sound qua sound is the order of the day. Kooshanejad works by breaking down samples into unrecognizable blips of sound, and then layering them up into thickets of melody and rhythm. There is the sense that any individual noise could be one locus on a larger waveform, any melodic line or rhythmic figure a patchwork of them.</p>\n<p>This leads to a lot of exciting moments that occur outside of traditional structures. Rhythms slur and slow down; melodies coagulate and dissipate. It's exciting or directionless depending on your mood. For this reason I prefer <em>I AKA I</em> when vestiges of Kooshanejad's music studies show up, such as on the stately melody that underpins &quot;Eluded,&quot; trading space with a halting, insidiously catchy melody. Or on &quot;Make It Fast,&quot; a lumpen hip-hop beat that contains trace elements of non-Western melodic modes (&quot;Shah&quot; offers a similar experience). &quot;Biutiful&quot; owns its title, a nod to late-90s Warp acts that prized both grace and oddity.</p>\n<p>Tracks like these offer windows with which to view Kooshanejad's work; how necessary the windows are will depend on your preferences. He's capable of being abstract (&quot;Growl&quot;) and obtuse (&quot;In Line&quot;) but while the album can be difficult it isn't exactly alien or otherworldly.\u00a0From the jarring opening moments of &quot;Ote&quot; we know exactly what world this hails from: the digital, where it has been zoomed and cropped and clipped and reversed and shuffled. If anything, <em>I AKA I</em> is a reminder of how normal these concepts are becoming.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>&quot;The music we make supposedly contains a lot of different styles, but it's not eclectic. It's a reflection of everything that we listen to and the people we interact with. We use 'dub' in our title because dub is a framework for experimentation, not just about reproducing a sound from a previous era.&quot; So says the liner notes from this reissue of Asian Dub Foundation's debut album, originally released in 1995. It's an interesting assertion, and one I'm inclined to agree with.</p>\n<p>True to that summary, <em>Facts and Fictions</em> does incorporate elements of many styles, but it really doesn't come across as eclectic, as every element is fully incorporated into a base sound that's fairly consistent from song to song, and, to a lesser extent, from album to album. You can hear the influence of dub in the way the music's put together; you can hear hip hop, jungle and bhangra in its rhythmic undercarriage, rock in the guitars, and traditional Bengali and North Indian music in the instrumentation and samples they employ. The resulting mix is something incredibly unique and frequently arresting, but while their music may wear multinational tendencies on its sleeve, their lyrics are fiercely, proudly Indian. This is third release of <em>Facts and Fictions</em>, and it's clothed in one of the most thoroughly awful covers I've seen in years. Yes it's the music that counts, but the artwork is inexcusable give that the label already had two better sleeves to choose from.</p>\n<p>The Foundation coalesced at a music technology workshop for Asian youth in London, and quickly developed a political stridency based on anti-racism, displayed vividly in their lyrics, without much mincing of words. Britain's large Indian population has long felt itself marginalized in their society, and not without reason, as the lingering haze of colonialism still refuses to fade away. Vocalist Deedar &quot;Master D&quot; Zaman peppers his raps with lines like &quot;We're often told that this country's bursting at the seams/ But we're never told that there are in fact more people leaving than entering/ Immigration has become synonymous with black people/ Yet over sixty percent of immigrants are white,&quot; laying out his case in the plainest possible terms.</p>\n<p>This is where we start to run up against some problems: at this early point in the Foundation's evolution, their righteousness was occasionally clumsy. Read those lines above again; they may be true, and it's an alarming reality (revealing some rotten agendas), but, god, it's not exactly poetry. On top of this, diction somewhat compromises the message Deedar strives so hard to put forth, due to his singularly odd mix of Cockney drawl and Reggae-influenced flow. The Foundation's lyrics occasionally seem to run at cross purposes as well, mixing messages like &quot;We are gonna/ Spread power with words,&quot; from &quot;Debris&quot; with lines that advocate violence against fascists: &quot;Time is getting short, elections in May/ Give the fascist man a gunshot-- that's the only way.&quot; I hate fascists, too, but this lowers the Foundation to the level of their enemies, and as a message, it's not constructive.</p>\n<p>However formative the album is as a whole, <em>Facts and Fictions</em> still contains a few stunning moments, such as the media indictment refrain to &quot;PKNB&quot;: &quot;The Sun [UK tabloid] has got its facts wrong and it's fucking up my day,&quot; delivered over a slowly morphing beat that creeps from slow and deliberate to driving and manic, with tabla loops keeping a constant pulse in the background. The single &quot;Rebel Warrior&quot; is the band's best early song, with its strangely calming swirl of keys, flutes, and sampled Indian singers forming a disarmingly comfortable backdrop for Deedar, railing against the final vestiges of British Empire. Chadrasonic's guitar is given more breathing room than usual, and Deedar relaxes his delivery, becoming more intelligible without sacrificing his style.</p>\n<p><em>Facts and Fictions</em> is an interesting look at where the Asian Dub Foundation got their start as politically-charged upstarts in the mid-90s, but I'd only recommend it to fans who don't already own it. Newcomers are much better off going for either <em>Rafi's Revenge</em> or <em>Community Music</em>, albums that showcase the Foundation in full, amazing effect.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>To quote Emma Goldman, &quot;If I can't dance, I don't want your revolution.&quot; The old anarchist revolutionary was actually taking a stand against behavioral fascism, but modern pop music has misinterpreted her in the best possible way. These days, the smart sonic insurgents employ the old bait-and-switch on their audiences, kicking out a booming beat to capture ears and rears alike before dropping the science on them. But this is hardly necessary when the message is melded with the music as eloquently and seamlessly as Asian Dub Foundation does it; in their collective hands, the protest song is not only alive and well, but thriving and evolving.</p>\n<p>As much musically innovative as they are politically active, Asian Dub Foundation's sound is a melting pot of jungly breakbeats, dub and dancehall flavors, and snaky guitar lines that morph from rock riffs into Indian sitars and back again, every element of which manages to stand out in the mix as often as it complements the others. <em>Rafi's Revenge</em>, the only other album of theirs readily available in the U.S., may have featured slightly better songwriting, but its thin, sterile drum-n-bass-style production detracted from its impact. In contrast, <em>Community Music</em> fills the empty spaces with exotic atmospherics that tickle the ear while the thicker, beefed-up production firmly plants a boot in it.</p>\n<p>I remember reading a review of Primal Scream's <em>Exterminator</em> that praised the band's newfound political anger and snarkily nicknamed the album &quot;The Battle of London.&quot; This is complete and utter bullshit. Compared to <em>Community Music</em>, <em>Exterminator</em> is a slick, empty style exercise, reducing powerful rhetoric to incoherent sound bytes that mostly serve as accouterments to Kevin Shields' fancy-schmancy noisemaking. The real British analog to Rage Against the Machine is undeniably Asian Dub Foundation, but that's still being unfair to both groups. Rage's blustery, in-your-face punk anger is uniquely American-- as much a hindrance as an asset; Asian Dub Foundation's sublimation of their discontent beneath their interest in getting people moving on the dance floor is, well... pretty British.</p>\n<p>Where Zack de la Rocha hisses and screams, Deedar sports a mush-mouthed dancehall phrasing that sounds at once laid-back and urgent; Chandrasonic is as adept a guitar technician as Tom Morello, deploying riffs that sear and snake or disappearing into clouds of delay noise. And instead of bleak teeth-gnashing and finger-pointing at The Man, Asian Dub Foundation sport a particularly positivist, unity-building vibe that in the hands of lesser artists would become peace-and-love sappiness or multicultural-studies didacticism, but the band makes sure to keep the edges rough while still making protest seem like celebration.</p>\n<p>If <em>Community Music</em> is flawed in any way, it's that at 70+ minutes, it can be an exhausting listen. Asian Dub Foundation jump out of the gate with a furious triple dis of Cool Britannia nostalgia (&quot;Real Great Britain&quot;), historical revisionism (&quot;Memory War&quot;), and police corruption (&quot;Officer XX&quot;) before settling down into more uplifting grooves, praising their immigrant ancestors on &quot;New Way New Life&quot; and urging listeners to get into the &quot;Collective Mode.&quot;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the energy level begins to sag just as your pulse rate rises; &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;The Judgement&quot; lean a bit too heavily on mellow reggae styles, and Deedar cedes vocal duties to spoken-word samples and other singers with varying success. While A. Sivanandan's speechifying on &quot;The Colour Line&quot; gets a bit heavy-handed, &quot;Taa Deem&quot; succeeds brilliantly on the strength of the sampled vocals of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan meshing with fierce, metallic guitar distortion and impossibly booming percussion. &quot;Truth Hides&quot; slinks along for a while on the strength of squeaky alien ambience and an enchantingly dark chorus, but it can't quite justify its eight-minute length.</p>\n<p>For all its rough spots, though, Asian Dub Foundation maintains the delicate balance between raising consciousness and shaking booty; the message never gets preachy, and the music can certainly stand well on its own, as it does on the instrumental coda &quot;Scaling New Heights.&quot; <em>Community Music</em> is incredibly ambitious, and amazingly, it delivers everything it promises and then some. It's a revolution, <em>and</em> you can dance to it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>German experimental electronic composer Asmus Tietchens isn't exactly the first person most people think of when they discuss synth pop. In fact, even among hardcore electronic music fans, he's more known for his longstanding dedication to academic electronic music in the spirit of Stockhausen and Pierre Henry, and in fact holds a position at the University of Hamburg. However, having also worked with Tangerine Dream's Peter Baumann, Conny Plank, Cluster, and Thomas K\u00f6ner, he's had more than a trivial say in the development of electronic pop. His first record for the Sky Records (also home to LPs by Cluster &amp; Eno and Neu!'s Michael Rother)-- 1981's <em>Biotop-- sounded like the work of a composer obviously at home with discordant textures and off-kilter beats, yet had a patchwork, DIY charm belying his pedigree as a &quot;serious&quot; composer. Die Stadt is engaged in an ongoing series of Tietchens reissues, and the three records he made after Biotop are full of small pleasures and electro-vignettes, the likes of which should readily appeal to fans of old-school electronica and new school lo-fi experimentation.</em></p>\n<p>1981's <em>Sp\u00e4t-Europa (or</em> <em>Late Europe), like</em> <em>Biotop</em> from earlier in the same year, sticks with short tunes as a matter of practice. Tietchens had planned to compose an album featuring nothing but two-minute songs, though without the benefit of a laptop or high-tech digital editing software, he settles for analog instrumentals ranging from 1:48 to just over two-and-a-half minutes. This kind of homemade efficiency is perfectly suited to his buoyant, if slightly out of focus instrumentals: &quot;Poanpo&quot; spirals upwards in waltz time, using mini-Moog electro-rays with a warped counterpoint; the title track, after a short, barely audible introduction of church bells and choral singing, pushes ahead at glacier pace, with its high-pitched, melancholy moan serving as a cold, lonely hymn. &quot;Ausverkauf&quot; picks up the pace, allowing some archaic drum machine to mimic Neu!'s Klaus Dinger while bizzaro-circus melodies fly by overheard. In fact, <em>Sp\u00e4t-Europa would make a fine soundtrack to an S&amp;M; fete taking place in the darkest corners of Berlin, replete with bruised mimes and aluminum-plated dancing boys. The cool pitter-patter of &quot;Passaukontrolle&quot; plays over credits to what is by turns a disturbing and almost precious scene.</em></p>\n<p>The following year's <em>In die Nacht (or</em> <em>In the Night</em>) lightens the length restriction, and seems a bit less claustrophic by comparison. &quot;Aus dem Tag&quot; (&quot;From the Day&quot;) sounds almost benevolent compared to the semi-twisted pieces on <em>Sp\u00e4t-Europa, and long stretches of breezy synth lines coupled with faux-music box ambience lend the track a cartoonish charm. The lengthy title track is much darker, with cavernous echo and a minor-key bass ostinato lurching behind a minimal, elongated melody that gradually morphs into something more bouncy. The obviously synthesized tambourine adds to the modest industrial feel, though Tietchens version of synth pop is always a little on the queasy side of goth. CD bonus tracks like &quot;W\u00fcrgstoffe&quot; and &quot;Niedermacher&quot; are less accommodating, seeming mystical and dark, and foreshadow the composer's headfirst dive into abstraction starting in the mid-1980s.</em></p>\n<p>1983's <em>Litia is an entirely different beast, at times closer to the quantized, Eno-fueled version of electronic music favored by contemporary synth pop think tanks like Kompakt, and elsewhere approaching the retro-futurism of Broadcast or Stereolab. &quot;Zeebr\u00fcgge&quot; might even fit on a</em> <em>Pop Ambient</em> compilation if you ignored the alien, pin-prickled sounds at the bridge, though the steady, down-tempo beat keeps things earthbound. (In fact, at the time, the Tietchens was worried his tunes were getting so robotic, he was compromising his own creativity.) Yet, on &quot;Abhuster Nebulizer&quot;, he predicts the experimental techno of Cristian Vogel and Felix Kubin, using crisp hi-hat and the barest hint of melody to make something very sleek, if slightly demented. &quot;Vorsaison&quot; uses a beat kin to Wire's &quot;Three Girl Rhumba&quot;, sprinkled with more of Tietchens' take on circus music, though not nearly so bizarre as on the previous records. If his earlier Sky LPs were seminal for IDM, <em>Litia is a convenient antecedent for electro-house and poppier end of minimal techno.</em></p>\n<p>Although <em>Litia is the most approachable of this trio of reissues, all of Tietchens' Sky material will be of interest to fans of vintage electronic pop. Immediately afterwards, beginning with 1984's</em> <em>Formen Letzter Hausmusik</em>, originally issued on Steven Stapleton's (Nurse With Wound) United Dairies imprint-- and part of Die Stadt's series of reissues-- he abandoned synth pop for musique concrete and some pretty uncompromisingly experimental music. I consider these albums something of an oasis in Tietchens' canon of concise, no-frills electronic pop, and though he may not quite be a household name for most people, he was certainly dedicated to making the most of his foray into the field.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Lopsided robots with unhinged plates and bits of wire dangling from their joints; malfunctioning machinery whose friendly, yet damaged hum provides the faintest clue its computerized emissions might have originated from a human mind: these scenes from the lab of German electronic music composer Asmus Tietchens are just a few skewed demonstrations of his distant mastery of highbrow composition guised in synth-pop's veneer. In the early 1980s, before he set out on a full-time mission of modern musique concrete and a goal of &quot;absolute music&quot; (that which doesn't necessarily paint a picture or tell a story, and most certainly makes no concessions to the accessible), Tietchens followed a detour into short, immediately distinctive electro-snap jingles for vintage German electronica label Sky Records (Moebius/Plank/Neumeier, Conrad Schnitzler). 1981's <em>Biotop</em> was only his second LP after 15 years of perfecting his craft, and should be right on time for folks down with futuristic pop like Cluster or Kraftwerk.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you're wondering, &quot;If this guy is so great, why haven't I heard of him?&quot; My guess is that since albums such as <em>Biotop</em>, and others like <em>Spat Europa</em> and <em>In Die Nacht</em> scheduled for reissue on Die Stadt, have never been available on CD until now. Also, Tietchens (born 1947 in Hamburg) has done a pretty good job of hiding from anyone who might dig strange, tuneful synthesizer ditties by concentrating on more &quot;serious,&quot; formalistic electronic works, and releasing albums on such notable experimental labels as Ritornell and Staalplaat. Klangkrieg's Felix Kubin has been an outspoken champion and collaborator of Tietchens, but for the most part, I'd say he hadn't exactly received much due outside of uber-hipster electronic music circles. With that in mind, <em>Biotop</em> is a delight, and with any luck, it will make Tietchens a household name-- at least in houses that already hold modern-day groups like Mouse on Mars, Kammerflimmer Kollektief and even The Notwist in high esteem.</p>\n<p>This reissue begins with two previously unreleased tracks that fit in very well with the rest of the album, and in fact serve as a nice summarization of the loopy, compact etudes contained therein. &quot;Futurum Drei&quot; gallops along with classic Moog lines reminiscent of ones made famous by Wendy Carlos in the early 1970s, though Tietchens isn't here to space you out. In fact, despite the odd layer of reverb and persistent, pinging bassline, the music doesn't seem so much an exercise in electronic composition, but the incidental music to a retro-futuristic movie about a trek through the desert. &quot;Fast Food&quot; is much more rhythmically forceful, featuring a goofy, pogo-bounce Latin beat that somehow makes Casio seem like the keyboard of choice for the discriminating listener. Better yet, Tietchens' melody is superb; fans of Yellow Magic Orchestra or early Human League (you know who you are, Plagenhoef) should get a major kick out of this.</p>\n<p>&quot;Modern Arroganz&quot; is synth-pop taken to its logical endpoint: uptempo robo-funk and staccato snare over which minimal Moog hits pitter-patter to no end alongside a computerized vocal proclaiming who knows what scarifying mantra. &quot;Tr\u00fcmmerk\u00f6pfe&quot; eases in with considerably less frantic precision, employing faux-exotica sound effects (Tietchens could have given Esquivel a run for his money) and a cha-cha 4/4 beat. In a bizarro universe (or the one in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>), maybe this stuff is used as super-strength advertisement music, offering homemakers of the future everything they could possibly need.</p>\n<p>Other pieces, like the title track, are more obviously experimental. &quot;Biotop&quot; begins on a single, piercing note and expands to include overtones from a whole range of synthesizer technology most musicians probably haven't even explored now, much less in 1981. As layer upon layer of bright, somehow comforting fuzz-ambience subsumes the original tone, it suddenly recedes like a supernova into a shadow of its former brilliance. Like most accomplished composers, Tietchens' had a way of making simple elements work wonders.</p>\n<p>Die Stadt is presently in the process of releasing all of Tietchens' early material in a series of 18 CDs, of which <em>Biotop</em> is the second. It's my favorite of his, and if you're interested in the development of IDM in any way, it's practically required listening. Of all the archival electronic recordings awaiting reissue, Tietchens' work on Sky is some of the most necessary, and consistently enjoyable. Highly recommended.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://www.atari-teenage-riot.com/\">Atari Teenage Riot</a> existed at a previously unimaginable fulcrum of genres, using every ingredient they could find to come up with an ecstatically assaultive squall. Their twisting, roiling blare had elements of pounding industrial, of mouth-foaming hardcore punk, of brutally fast hardcore rave, of scraping electronic noise, of thrash-metal bombast, of wriggling drill-n-bass, of Bomb Squad-style attack-beats. Their specific chaotic combination added up to German-accented ridiculousness (&quot;Deutschland! Has gotta! <em>Diiieeee</em>!&quot;) screamed over hyperspeed 808 pounds and digitally treated guitar fuzz; it seemed scientifically engineered to annoy as many people as possible. It was impossible to dance or talk or read or drive or do <em>anything else</em> while they were playing. I tried <em>so hard</em> to like them, and I mostly succeeded, even though my friends would give me tons of shit anytime I played their records.</p>\n<p>For a brief moment in the mid-1990s, the group seemed like the future. They released records on Grand Royal, they opened the much-touted Rage Against the Machine/Wu-Tang Clan tour, and they spearheaded their own little mini-scene with their Digital Hardcore label. But after 11 years of inactivity, it's pretty clear that they didn't exactly change the conversation. You can detect pieces of their style in a few musical movements that have come along since: the Teutonic-accented confrontationalism of electroclash, the low-budget rabble-rousing computer-pop of early M.I.A., the squealing brickwalled dance-metal of Justice. But Atari Teenage Riot didn't transcend their moment. So their new album, <em>Is This Hyperreal?</em>, is a curious thing indeed: a nostalgic work that evokes an idea of the future that turned out to be absurd. Listening to it is like watching a remake of <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>.</p>\n<p>The reconstituted Atari Teenage Riot of 2011 isn't really the same group from that mid-90s moment. Unhinged hypeman Carl Crack died in 2001. Lead screamer Hanin\u00a0Elias is long gone, though replacement Nic Endo sounds almost <em>exactly</em> like her. There's also a new member: laughably clumsy American MC CX Kidtronik (sample lyrics: &quot;My fist! My fist! I bang my fist! Against a concrete wall!&quot;). But even with a ton of membership turnover, Atari Teenage Riot sound very, very similar to what mastermind Alec Empire first unleashed a decade and a half ago. Then again, it's not like those early records left a whole lot of room for aesthetic advancement (what, were they going to find a new genre of noisy assault music to incorporate?). But it's still pretty weird that this band's overwhelming fury has not mellowed in the slightest since they've been away. They're not teenagers anymore, but you'd never know it from listening to them.</p>\n<p>That's not exactly a compliment. Teenagers experience politics in absolutes; red-faced sloganeering makes a lot more sense to a human ball of hormones than nuanced discourse ever could. But when a grown man roars, &quot;They want to turn the Internet into their personal global chessboard!&quot; it just sounds goofy (who's <em>they</em>?). Some of the lyrics on <em>Is This Hyperreal?</em> push those tendencies to dizzy extremes. Consider, for example, this: &quot;Capitalism, you're a little fat man in a big expensive car hanging over a ravine here!&quot; Or this bit of anti-Internet agitprop: &quot;When the authorities catch up with us, <em>and they will</em>, it's not such a good idea to leave traces and expose your whole network at once!&quot; (Yes, Atari Teenage Riot have their own iPhone app. Why do you ask?) Musically, too, it's the same hyperspeed noise-blast format they've been working forever, beyond the odd moment of Crystal Castles-style mutated video-game bloop. When &quot;Shadow Identity&quot; turns into deeply pretty M83-ish epic synthpop for a minute, it's a legit shock: This band learned a new trick! But it's just for a few seconds at the end of the song, and then it's over.</p>\n<p>Redundant as it may be, though, <em>Is This Hyperreal?</em> succeeds simply as unintentional nostalgia, at least for someone who experienced the band the first time around. Opening track &quot;Activate!&quot;, for instance, is pretty much Crystal Method-style big beat, but with more guitar fuzz and screaming, and it's just <em>fun</em>. The fact that Atari Teenage Riot still exist in any form, and that they're still making these sputtering tantrums, is almost admirable. They're gloriously silly anachronisms, and I'm not sorry to have them back in my life. My friends probably aren't too happy, though.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Revivals aren't unusual, in music or in other areas of culture. Rarer is the revival that goes beyond nostalgia and sets itself up to be eventually revived in its own right. I keep seeing the phrase &quot;Balearic&quot; used in different ways, so let's be clear: For our purposes, the term refers to a late-1980s style linked to Ibiza, where clattering acid house had given way among some DJs to a mellower, more eclectic mindset that made room for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SaBnTqIRFM\">extended Cure remixes</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PxJNkoeWi8\">Italo-house krautrock appropriations</a>\u2014and Chris Rea's soft-rock guitar workout <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbCmMaqG8_Q\">&quot;Josephine&quot;</a>.\u00a0But the scene was never limited to Spain, and by the mid- to late '00s a Balearic revival had taken hold, much of it centered in Scandinavian groups, not least of them a Gothenburg-based duo known as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/\">Studio</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/27424-d-lissvik/\">Dan Lissvik</a>, aka <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/atelje\">Atelje</a>, was one half of Studio. What he accomplished with collaborator Rasmus H\u00e4gg\u00a0around that time, especially on 2006's\u00a0<em>West Coast</em> (and 2007's somewhat-overlapping <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9898-yearbook-1/\"><em>Yearbook 1</em> compilation</a>), looms larger now that we've had some years to see how singular it was. You can spot traces of their aesthetic, musically and visually, in minimalist electronic producer Nicolas Jaar's work with guitarist Dave Harrington as\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/\">Darkside</a>, and you can find other cosmic guitar instrumentalists not unlike Lissvik, most notably former <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/\">Emeralds</a> member <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/\">Mark McGuire</a>.\u00a0But Studio had a particular way of blending largely Balearic elements and exploring them, sometimes at great length, while also maintaining enough sly conceptual unity, enough tunefulness, for easy first-impression appeal. Last year, in a measure of Studio's enduring influence,\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/\">Jamie xx</a> sampled <em>West Coast</em>/<em>Yearbook 1</em>'s &quot;Out There&quot; for his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/54887-jamie-xx-releases-new-song-girl/\">&quot;Girl&quot;</a>\u00a0single.</p>\n<p>Lissvik has stayed busy, but Studio called it quits and shut down their label, Information, at the beginning of 2012. That farewell was part of a broader moment of closure for the scene:\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/\">Air France</a>, who took a more <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/\">Saint Etienne</a>- and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/\">Avalanches</a>-leaning approach toward the Balearic idea, broke up not long after, and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/49362-rip-service-swedish-label-behind-jens-lekman-tough-alliance-studio-whitest-boy-alive/\">Service</a>, the Gothenburg label that nurtured Studio and others in the early '00s, gave up the ghost in January 2013. Since 2008's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11923-yearbook-2/\"><em>Yearbook 2</em></a>, a comp containing Studio reworkings of other artists' songs,\u00a0H\u00e4gg has done production for gut-wrenching Swedish singer-songwriter\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4788-el-perro-del-mar/\">El Perro Del Mar</a>, and in 2013 he <a href=\"http://blogg.svt.se/psl/2013/10/02/rasmus-haggs-musik-ar-stulen-ge-tillbaka-den-genast/\">told an interviewer</a> he'd lost four to five solo albums in a burglary. Lissvik has been the more publicly prolific, showcasing his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/\">Vini Reilly</a>-goes-to-warmer-climes instrumentals on a late-2008 solo album as D. Lissvik, \u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/\">7 Trx + Intermission</a>,</em> and teaming up with Fredrik Lindson of fellow Service alums <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/12665-the-embassy/\">the Embassy</a> for a charmingly low-key 2009 LP as the\u00a0Cr\u00eapes\u2014that is, when not producing for the likes of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28811-ceo/\">CEO</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/5330-taken-by-trees/\">Taken by Trees</a>, or remixing everyone from <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/\">Fever Ray</a> to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/\">Haim</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Meditation</em> is the most Studio-like full-length we've heard from Lissvik since his former band. That not-quite-reggae lope is back, along with hypnotic yet lyrical guitar repetitions, dubwise bass, and Nordic space-disco synths. As ever with Balearic, part of the formula is that there is no formula, as seen in the twinkling piano on the album's bookends &quot;Ode to Studio&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot; (the latter with strummy acoustic guitar). And those Studio-era yearning vocals are long gone. Still, when the LP gets into a cosmic groove, especially on side B's percolating &quot;Everslick&quot; or its gentle, piano-sprinkled comedown &quot;Transition&quot;, the effect recalls the Balearic revival at its peak. Considering, again, that the title of the opening track is &quot;Ode to Studio&quot;, that might not be an accident.</p>\n<p>Back-to-roots moves can be a bit hackneyed in rock, or at the very least seen as a bit of a retreat, but I don't get that sense here. It might help to remember that the original Balearic beat was as much about context as content: Rea's &quot;Josephine&quot; or, to take a Studio-remixed example, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/\">Kylie Minogue</a>'s &quot;2 Hearts&quot; belongs not because it was necessarily supposed to but simply because it can. <em>Meditation</em>\u00a0plays as a thoroughly absorbing meditation on\u2014or ode to\u2014Studio, and it works because it does; there's still nothing else quite like this. With only 300 copies pressed, most of us probably won't be able to own the LP\u00a0on vinyl, and at slightly more than half an hour, Lissvik doesn't quite get a chance to stretch out the way Studio could. But there's reason to hope for at least at least a personal musical revival: Diehard watchers of Studio will know Lissvik has shared 50 tracks, as <em>Archive</em>, on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lissvik\">his SoundCloud</a>, and a tantalizing new solo single, &quot;Airwalk&quot; b/w &quot;Shuvit&quot;, is <a href=\"http://boomkat.com/downloads/1173421-dan-lissvik-shuvit\">on the way</a> in February via <a href=\"http://www.smalltownsupersound.com/\">Smalltown Supersound</a>. As Lissvik wrote when Studio ended, &quot;See you in another shape and form.&quot;</p>\n",

Take The Dead Milkmen, The Dead Kennedys, or They Might Be Giants-- who had a really good song called &quot;Dead&quot;-- or browse the single-syllable branch, with representatives like Devo, Ween, and Cex. It's not much of a stretch to assume that Atom &amp; His Package imagines himself a part of this genetic lineage, but his true mentor seems to be a comedy-rock star that shines a bit more brightly: parody king &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.</p>\n<p>Now, far be it from me to front on The Al-- after all, I was an eleven year-old boy once. In fact, I still have an autographed ticket stub from a Weird Al show, a performance at a dinner theater at which I saw my first ever moshers during &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;. You might even say Al played a formative role in my musical development. No, let's not say that.</p>\n<p>Unlike me, Adam Goren doesn't seem like he'd be too ashamed by the comparison. He's got the nostril-heavy vocals, he occasionally borrows a melody or two from the pop culture consciousness, and instead of an accordion, he's got the sequencer companion he calls His Package (clearly a statement on the technologicalization of sexual organs in our increasingly impersonal and technical lives. Or just a cheap laugh). He might avoid overt song parodies, but that was only half of the Yankovic catalog: the rest of his albums were filled out with, er, classics like &quot;Nature Trail to Hell (In 3-D)&quot;.</p>\n<p>On <em>Attention! Blah Blah Blah</em>, however, Goren is doing stand-up, with pretty limp material. Here's a song about marrying your grandma! Hey-o! Here's a song about why Atom doesn't want to have kids! Here's a song about smashing things with a hammer! I'm not totally averse to humor in music, but these jokes are sitcom-bad, and especially disappointing given that Atom has been reasonably funny in the past: the way &quot;Punk Rock Academy&quot; inexplicably becomes an Eddie Money cover halfway through, or the spot-on, caffeinated, Le Tigre-referencing rant of &quot;If You Own the Washington Redskins, You're a Cock&quot;.</p>\n<p>The closest to thing to &quot;If You Own the Washington Redskins&quot; on <em>Attention</em> is &quot;The Palestinians Are Not the Same Thing as the Rebel Alliance, Jackass&quot;, which never gets funnier than that doozy of a title right there. Two minutes of breakneck-speed anti-war protestor mockery that scores a couple valid points, it falls flat as satire, and Atom can't help but cut himself with double-edged statements like, &quot;You people who generalize are all the same!&quot;</p>\n<p>Compounding these problems, <em>Attention</em> shows Atom &amp; His Package isn't even as musically compelling as he's been on previous outing, and he wasn't all that compelling to begin with. Where Goren once offered up a welcome slice of synthy levity between bands at a thousand over-serious emo shows, he now sounds like he's auditioning for the next Blink-182 tour, coating nearly every song with crunchy pop-punk guitar glaze. Capable, not-quite-Postal Service moments of programming-- the pizzicato strings of &quot;Friend, Please Stop Smoking&quot; or the epileptic rhythms of &quot;Possession (Not the One by Danzig)&quot;-- are lost beneath the N\u00fc-Weezer metal riffing.</p>\n<p>The sad fact is, a project like Atom &amp; His Package suffers from the They Might Be Giants quandary: the more it sounds like a real band, and the more it takes itself seriously, the worse it becomes. Essentially, this means Atom &amp; His Package is painted into a corner of stagnation, doomed to repeat himself with the musical editorials and danced-up Mountain Goats covers that got him this far. But hey, chin up, Atom-- doing the same thing over and over again has given &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic a long, virtuous career and a killer episode of <em>Behind the Music</em>-- you could be next!</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If you relocated <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/\">Stereolab</a> from a retro-futurist bachelor's pad to an indie rocker's Williamsburg walkup, you might get something like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4822-au-revoir-simone/\">Au Revoir Simone</a>, a trio who play old keyboards and sing simple harmonies over rickety drum machines. Their patterned musical figures and calmly rendered vocal lines create a sense of pleasant remove from their subject matter, which is usually devotion. Smoothing down charged emotions with something between plucky self-control and spooky disassociation, Erika Forster, Annie Hart, and Heather D'Angelo can seem all the more ghostly for how they blend together on record, which gives their most private and personal sentiments an airy, collective tinge of the afterlife. But while staying that course for the last decade, the trio has cautiously let more irregularity and individuality creep into their electronic dream pop. The process of letting go accelerates on their most raucous album to date, <em>Move in Spectrums</em>, their first since drifting apart after 2009's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13000-still-night-still-light/\"><em>Still Night, Still Light</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The title of Au Revoir Simone's debut, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9182-verses-of-comfort-assurance-salvation/\"><em>Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation</em></a>, summed up the candidly inspirational milieu of their first two records and, to a lesser extent, their pivotal third one. <em>Verses</em> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9941-the-bird-of-music/\"><em>The Bird of Music</em></a> set sentimental homilies against toy-like sounds, striking a balance between innocent sweetness and unnerving detachment that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/5393124/David-Lynchs-darlings-Au-Revoir-Simone.html\">caught the ear</a> of someone who perfected the blend, David Lynch. But with <em>Still Night, Still Light</em>, a change took hold. The band grew a dance music spine, the drum machines pounding as often as spritzing, and their lyrical themes grew more downcast and mature, if still couched in consoling tones. Their music had always felt like a nocturnal illumination, but now it evoked neon flashes on dark city streets more than a nightlight, with the worldliness of electro-pop displacing the formative influences of the baby's mobile, the lullaby, the music box.</p>\n<p>After spending several years working on other projects and regrouping, Au Revoir Simone pick up that leveler gaze where it left off on <em>Move in Spectrums</em>. Even fans of <em>Still Night</em> might be surprised by the hefty black synthesizer that opens the record, a far cry from the group\u2019s origins in sparkling lightness. Throughout, their drum machine programming, which used to tend toward a compact fizz, is spacious and storm-lashed, roiling with grayscale tones. \u00a0The music strays into some thin atmosphere during the home stretch, but before that it feels stronger and more driven than ever before. The record is frontloaded with its best pop looks: &quot;More Than&quot; demonstrates a new vocal mobility and freedom, oscillating powerfully between a bare <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/\">Georgia Hubley</a>-like murmur and \u00a0a scrambling unison chorus; &quot;The Lead is Galloping&quot; has the commanding icy patina of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/\">Broadcast</a>; and album highlight <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15903-crazy/\">&quot;Crazy&quot;</a> bolts along on a stuttering electric note with a bouncy vocal delivery worthy of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/\">Tracyanne Campbell</a>.</p>\n<p>The synth that simulates a guitar is most prominent, in delayed glassy shards, on the down-tempo &quot;We Both Know&quot;, which represents the best of the album's more pensive side. The sluggish attack and slow tom rolls of &quot;Boiling Point&quot; begin a gentle unraveling of the music's seams. &quot;Love You Don\u2019t Know Me&quot; cycles one lyric over little more than naturalistic piano tones and a loose snare, and feels more like running out of ideas than profound understatement. More engagingly, &quot;Hand Over Hand&quot; runs a notched synth note through rough silk chords, though the drums from earlier in the record are missed. But this low-impact stretch perks up with the svelte dance-pop of &quot;Just Like a Tree&quot;, \u00a0the soulful and joyous <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15668-somebody-who/\">&quot;Somebody Who&quot;</a>, and especially &quot;Gravitron&quot;, which feels like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/\">M83</a> personalized for Au Revoir Simone's more intimate world. Dramatic and driving, it never quite escapes the upper atmosphere, though thick loopy synth shapes provide an ample climax, showing how this band can go bigger without forsaking its cloistered center.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Part of what's disappointing about <em>Night Light</em>, the companion remix album to Au Revoir Simone's <em>Still Night, Still Light</em>, is that it takes everything implicit about the band's music and makes it explicit. With other artists, this might be a good thing-- and certainly the project of &quot;remixing a band&quot; is all about making room for an outside vision to suss out a song's hidden impulses, unexplored angles, buried hooks, latent possibilities, and so on-- to get that coveted and aerating &quot;perspective.&quot; Sometimes, this works out well (listen to the Tanlines remix of &quot;Shadows&quot;, mysteriously not included here). But for the most part, Au Revoir Simone's three-girl synth-pop is already such an elegant synthesis of different styles that their remixes-- and at this point, nearly three-quarters of their catalog has been remixed-- are like hearing a joke dismantled: They do little for the joke and even less for the person telling it.</p>\n<p>In that sense, the fact that <em>Night Light</em> is all over the place is a testament to how good <em>Still Night, Still Light</em> is. People remixing these tracks are hearing chipper club-pop, Francophilic variety-show music, disco-lite, and bedroom chorales. (For eight minutes, we even get to hear Au Revoir Simone as dubstep, and let me tell you that it is a merciless eight minutes.) Part of what makes <em>Still Night, Still Light</em> replayable is how discreet it is in pooling its influences together. The remixes, then, tell me things I already knew: one, that Au Revoir Simone are subtly reminiscent of a whole lot of different styles, which is a big part of why they have a smart and coherent vision as artists; and two, that all that subtlety is a big part of what made me love them in the first place.</p>\n<p>A note on subtlety: I know that this band can come off as cute and antiseptic, and for a few years I was much more interested in where their dresses came from than what their music sounded like. But between <em>The Bird of Music</em> and <em>Still Night</em>, their poise became refined to the point of eerie-- it was like watching someone walking with a library book on her head for an hour instead of thirty seconds. Their lyrics took a similar turn: All of a sudden, they were singing metaphor-free confrontations like, &quot;I'm moving on/ I hope you're coming with me/ Because I'm not strong without you,&quot; or, &quot;Oh joy! I can see you/ It's all I want&quot;-- lines so direct that they left no room to run from-- in pretty, unison harmony. In short, their minuses became plusses.</p>\n<p>The contributors to <em>Night Light</em> are a mix of people I had trouble finding out much about even after Googling (Bass Clef? Your Twenties?) and people I didn't (Neon Indian, Jens Lekman). One thing the higher-profile contributors have in common is that they're not known for their remixes. My guess is that most of them are friends, whether from living in Brooklyn (the Dirty Projectors' Deradoorian; Neon Indian) or from sharing an aesthetic sensibility (Jens Lekman; Montag). And to be fair, a few of these are pretty good, especially Lekman's (who takes the formerly driving &quot;Shadows&quot; and turns it into lilting, Hollywood jazz) and Clock Opera's quasi-tropical version of &quot;Tell Me&quot;, which practically writes a new melody with fragments of the old one. To my ears-- which have heard the originals a hundred times-- the ones that work out work out because they're both unexpected and careful.</p>\n<p>After a tour-only remix EP and a full album of remixes for <em>The Bird of Music</em>, <em>Night Light</em> feels like an unnecessary product. I know, I know, the whole concept of musical &quot;product&quot; is increasingly out of date, and the low returns and inevitable piracy of music actually makes flooding the market a semi-reasonable thing to do. As it is, Au Revoir Simone have about the most unpredictable, accessory-like cultural existence a band from Williamsburg could have: Almost nobody I know listens to them, but they've been on &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;; David Lynch is a fan; they play fashion shows; and I once saw a poster of theirs in the window of an Agn\u00e8s B. shop at an upscale mall in Hong Kong. Still, with an album as good as <em>Still Night, Still Light</em>, there's no reason to sully the brand.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>When it comes to decorum, Brooklyn's Au Revoir Simone makes Judith Martin look like Don Rickles. They have three voices, three keyboards, and a drum machine in their arsenal, yet each element stands out from the gleaming propulsion with razored precision, as if the band were constantly saying, &quot;No, after <em>you</em>.&quot; They deliver inspirational-kitten-calendar platitudes that would make Whitney Houston blush with disarming directness, their plain yet dulcet voices arranged in fussy group harmony-- excessive melisma being, after all, simply immodest. The band's egalitarian and mutually supportive dynamic pays off on the harmonious <em>Still Night, Still Light</em>, their third and best album. It's feather-light electro-pop that's not to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>As always, the music is utterly innocent of abrasion, dissonance, and chance-- everything is clamped down so tightly that the unstinting pertness seems neurotic; the insistence on letting go, moving on, and being who you are a &quot;doth protest too much&quot; kind of thing. You start to wonder what sort of roiling emotional bedlam all of this chipper well-being is keeping at bay. Yet the starchy sincerity keeps things merrily ambiguous, and politeness saturates the lyrics as well as the music. &quot;Only You Can Make You Happy&quot; feels like stumbling into the daily affirmation part of a group-therapy session, were it sung in a melting madrigal over lazily scudding synthesizers.</p>\n<p>The contrast between goopy sentiments and rigorous music is one thing that makes Au Revoir Simone unique, but their take on the break-up song is of even greater interest. They hospice their own love affairs with tenderness and grace, thereby avoiding the garden varieties-- vindictive, triumphant, pathetic, unilateral-- of the form. They strive for consensus in &quot;let's discuss this reasonably until we both agree to break up in a loving and supportive fashion&quot; songs, and achieve some of their sharpest lyrics in this mode. On &quot;Shadows&quot;, they sing, &quot;I'm moving on/ I hope you're coming with me/ Because I'm not strong without you.&quot; Come with me by going away, help me be strong enough to leave you-- it's a crafty illustration of romantic intractability.</p>\n<p>Despite their veneer of cunning na\u00efvet\u00e9, there is much more to Au Revoir Simone than rudimentary keyboards and adorable pigtails. &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, a chiming bedtime anthem about getting drunk in taxicabs, supports the notion that the group's studied banality is less of a worldview than a wish. They're still turning out ditties of piercing simplicity-- &quot;The Last One&quot; and &quot;Take Me As I Am&quot; could be transcribed for a baby's mobile with little loss of effect-- but there are also svelte keyboards in deft counterpoint on &quot;Knight of Wands&quot; and carefully contrasted bright and matte tones in the riff of &quot;Only You Can Make You Happy&quot;. The songs move with lathed elegance from skeletal to bursting and back again. The clich\u00e9s arrive at a breathtaking clip, imbued not with the melodrama of pop theater, but the earnest intimacy of a friend murmuring in your ear.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Light and breezy, Au Revoir Simone's synth-pop debut <em>The Bird of Music</em> didn't make a huge splash in 2007, but the Brooklyn trio has nevertheless commissioned a set of remixes. To be fair, Au Revoir Simone aren't treating <em>Reverse Migration</em> as a proper brick-and-mortar release-- it arrives without the usual PR blitz and is available only as a digital download from certain online retailers-- but the album (and others like it, see Stars' disastrous <em>Do You Trust Your Friends?</em>) helps to illustrate the frustrating overabundance of unnecessarily reworked material being hurled at listeners. Want more proof? Take a listen to the bounty of remixes clogging up music-blog aggregators such as Hype Machine and count how few actually move you and how many are there to give bloggers another reason/excuse to keep a band's name in the elbo.ws headlines.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same exercise can be applied here: Despite several high-caliber contributors, <em>Reverse Migration</em> never really gets off the ground. The bulk of its remixers pay too much deference to the source material and wind up with versions that don't enhance their originals. Gothenburg-based electro pop duo Pacific! tries for a Grizzly Bear-ish haunted Americana take on &quot;Sad Song&quot;, but their gawky rendering falls flat. Darkel (aka Air's Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel) puts his lunar spin on &quot;I Couldn't Sleep&quot;, isolating the vocals and sprinkling in some &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; synths, but there's little that's captivating about his mix. And there are a few real stinkers, too: The recreation of &quot;Stars&quot; by New York's Disco Pusher has all of the qualities of a cheap dance remix-- a basic 4/4 backing, cheesy vocoders-- without even a trace of originality to wash them down.</p>\n<p>A few musicians do manage to score: Sneering UK party starters the Teenagers turn &quot;Fallen Snow&quot; into a sinister glitch pop track, their adaptation superior to its precedent and a first cousin of Crystal Castles' menacing 2008 juggernaut &quot;Untrust Us&quot;. Montag's work on &quot;A Violent Yet Flammable World&quot; is equally intriguing; the French-Canadian producer splits the track in half, adding orchestral touches and lush synths to its back end for a vivid, luminous effect.</p>\n<p>The record's lone moment of true inventiveness comes from a likely source, Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, the only artist to use his remix as an opportunity to fabricate an entirely new track. Indeed, his remarkable take on &quot;Sad Song&quot; doesn't share as much a note of similarity to its precursor; Taylor mutilates the track and then reconstructs it as an eight-minute future-pop epic packed with mechanical distortions and flapping, rubbery synths. And when Taylor croons in his geeky, guileless manner, &quot;Play me a sad song... I want you to make me cry&quot;, it comes across as more earnest and believable than when ARS breathily told us the same. It's not enough, this song, to pull <em>Reverse Migration</em> out of the why-do-we-need-this pile, but it helps to remind us what a great remix can be-- how, when done properly, it can elevate the source material and reveal new layers to a song we thought we knew. It's funny to be reminded of this while listening to an album that's constantly trying to persuade us otherwise.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This is the information age, so of course it's harder than ever to find out the stuff that's really worth knowing. Dozens of blogs posted recently about the new Au Revoir Simone album, and what was my favorite discovery? A goddamn B-side. As remixed by profane London/Paris dance-poppers the Teenagers, the Brooklyn trio's &quot;Fallen Snow&quot; brings out the hidden creepiness in its wispy vocals, but you won't find its future-haunted beats on <em>The Bird of Music</em>-- though these three women do come (HOMG!) David Lynch-approved.</p>\n<p>Au Revoir Simone's sophomore effort opts for the fluttering, Casio-tinted synth-pop of debut <em>Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation</em>, but getting past its sleepy analog atmospheres still takes some persistence. Anyway, lo-fi casualness is kinda the point; Pitchfork's Brian Howe has even called the group's music &quot;the anti-synth-pop to the Moldy Peaches' anti-folk&quot;. On <em>The Bird of Music</em>, Au Revoir Simone have little trouble keeping up their offhand aesthetic. The album transcends this stylized nonchalance only when the compositions show some extra care.</p>\n<p>Intrepid listeners can find the album's brightest moments on its second half, after the low-tempo thrum of &quot;I Couldn't Sleep&quot; (don't believe it) and the &quot;Be My Baby&quot;-beating organ swirl of &quot;A Violent Yet Flammable World&quot; (future Sufjan project?). Bright, no-apologies dance-pop songs like &quot;Dark Halls&quot; and &quot;Night Majestic&quot; at last find some tunes that stick, along with some less threadbare lyrical concerns-- like horse races! On &quot;Lark&quot;, glistening keyboards finally eschew the emotional detachment of the record's earlier slow songs, beneath an even-toned admission: &quot;Sometimes I want to be enough for you.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>The Bird of Music</em>'s first half is a milky slog, drawing on the sparse electronics of Pipas or Young Marble Giants without the eccentricities that made those acts worthwhile. Despite a great video and sunny organ sound, the original &quot;Fallen Snow&quot; is a disappointingly tepid tale of romantic frustrations, even as it tosses off a decent line about &quot;women who are middle-aged with naked fingers.&quot; Loneliness usually feels more personal. Undeterred, &quot;Sad Song&quot; perks up for Postal Service cubicle-weeping about sad songs and wanting to cry. After opener &quot;The Lucky One&quot; gets wind chimes and somber electric piano about right, it builds up to choir-like nonsense that'd make the Polyphonic Spree lose faith: &quot;Let the sunshine, let it come/ To show us that tomorrow is eventual.&quot; Well, it's only a day away.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>While the Brooklyn-based trio Au Revoir Simone's synth-pop is always simple, elegant, and ethereal, it's expressed in two distinct modes which approximately divide the album. The first is musically fanciful and lyrically Pollyannaish, and it dominates the first half of the album and makes good on the promises implicit in its title. On &quot;Through the Backyards&quot;, a swaying keyboard melody and subtle twitters ride pneumatically hissing percussion. Band members Heather D'Angelo, Erika Forster, and Annie Hart breathe out dulcet harmonies over the rigid rhythm of the music, rhapsodizing about cherry trees and declaring that you can &quot;just make a wish and everything comes true.&quot; The drum machines on &quot;Hurricanes&quot; pop and trill beneath bright keyboards until canned applause segues into a jaunty Charlie Brown piano. The vocal melody and the didactic platitudes it contains are remindful of Kimya Dawson: &quot;Dreaming takes you where you want to be/ Don't follow the status quo/ Picture where you'd like go.&quot; It's not realistic, but it's not supposed to be -- it's encouragement, the anti-synth-pop to the Moldy Peaches anti-folk, without the schmaltzy affectations.</p>\n<p>In the record's second half, a contrary mood takes over-- Au Revoir Simone are still concerned with romance, but they shed their bubbly pep for a dark, cool menace. &quot;Back in Time&quot; announces this shift with an insistently pulsing drum and dreamy synths that billow up in clouds, shot through with a mournful bleat. It's still sprightly but murkier and less obvious than the preceding tracks, the soundtrack to a crisis of faith. If the album's first half is imbued with a summery sense of hope and good cheer, it's starting to feel a bit threadbare by &quot;The Winter Song&quot;, the way a sunny sky looks thin and provisional in winter. By the time it peters out into the windblown barrenness that inaugurates &quot;And Sleep Al Mar&quot;, it's as if seasonal affective disorder had taken over in earnest. The song throbs with the ominous swing of Air's <em>Virgin Suicides</em> score and stately piano figures as the trio murmurs discomfiting come-ons: &quot;Teenage Mexican boy/ Don't be shy/ \u2018Cause I could listen to Spanish all night.&quot;</p>\n<p>The album feels bifurcated in a way that's not unsatisfying, but Au Revoir Simone is at their best when they manage to embody whimsy and realism within a single track on &quot;Where You Go&quot;. For the most part, it's the usual volley of basic piano phrases and cascading synths; dreamy chirps of &quot;where you go is where I want to be.&quot; But near the end, it collapses into a sleek minor key bounce that echoes the lyrical turn from naivet\u00e9 to a more sophisticated (i.e. jaded) view of romance: &quot;It was late at night, I met you at a party / It was a crowded room, I couldn't hear you talking / You tried to hold my hand and then you left without me.&quot; The synths on final track &quot;Stay Golden&quot; percolate with restrained urgency, and amid their tight swirl, a sentiment rings out that sounds like the mature Au Revoir Simone of the record's back half rebuking the green one of the front half: &quot;Your faith was an illusion.&quot; Luckily, if that gets you down, you're welcome to let the album spin back to the first song and start building the pretty illusion again.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Auburn Lull have proven surprisingly hard to forget. Minor members of Michigan's minor space rock scene-- think Burnt Hair Records, Windy and Carl, Mahogany; call it suburbgaze-- the Lansing quartet are now on their fourth Darla release: a reissued 1999 debut, a rarities comp, and two proper full-lengths. And like the copy of <em>Alone I Admire</em> I copped so many years ago in one of those same Michigan suburbs, <em>Begin Civil Twilight</em> reminds of a time when I very nearly bought a Landing record every time I entered a record store and when I actually did buy a used Flying Saucer Attack album every time I entered a record store. Auburn Lull sell a particularly dense, nurtured form of dream-pop that acts as an admirably neutral standard for a genre and scene whose survival instincts have proven cockroach-like.</p>\n<p>Auburn Lull sport a perfectly shoegaze-y name-- well, perfectly American anyway, as those E'd-up cross-pond Brits wouldn't be caught dead in something so drearily Midwestern-- but even that genre would imply too much grit: <em>Begin Civil Twilight</em> takes far more cues from ambient or even new age music. Guitarist/vocalist Sean Heenan captains the band with a sadistically slow metronome; drummer Jason Wiesinger possesses either otherworldly patience or mountains of sedatives. Along with guitarists/bassists Jason Kolb and Eli Wekenman they resist any and all temptation to create friction or to amass tension. Apply all standard music-critic buzzwords to the guitars: float, drift, languish, glide. Drum patterns are whisked away like accumulated rain from a windshield.</p>\n<p>Compared to their peers, Auburn Lull are relatively less willing to blur their sounds-- guitars and keyboards mostly meld, but there are traceable lines drawn between the vocals, bass, and drums. The difference seems to arise less out of a desire to produce proper pop music than to not let Heenan's understated delivery and actual melodies go to waste. Opener &quot;Light Through the Canopy&quot; peels away to reveal a heavily reverberated Heenan worming his way through a contoured melody: &quot;This is how it's supposed to go,&quot; he claims, light/lite guitars wearing threadbare behind him in confirmation. &quot;Broken Heroes&quot;, <em>Twilight</em>'s most overt pop stab, relies on little more than intermittent bass gurgles during the verse, allowing Heenan and wife Elsa room to mourn in unison. &quot;November's Long Shadows&quot; (stereotypical song title alert level: Orange) features a curlicue lead guitar that cuts through the ever-present sheen and gives the song a vague college-rock feel. &quot;Coasts&quot;, ironically, is the closest <em>Twilight</em> comes to propulsion, dancing with a skittish high-hat before stumbling into a jog, little guitar bends and stabs darting in and out of a tastefully martial drum pattern.</p>\n<p>While the band's lack of saturation has heretofore worked to its advantage, with each successive release Auburn Lull sound less like squirreled-away torch-guarders and more like a veteran group of studio wizards retracing their steps very, very, very slowly. <em>Twilight</em> contains plenty of Auburn Lull autopilot: little tone poems with vague clips of dialogue (&quot;Geneva&quot;), four and five minute swaths of effected guitar (&quot;Civil Twilight&quot;), or blank soundscapes that serve only as cots for pretty acoustic noodling (&quot;Stanfield Echo&quot; and, most egregiously, the untitled nine-minute closer). These are not offensive compositions, just extraneous ones that seem like dead weight for a band three albums in and capable of lovingly muted pop. Auburn Lull remain charmingly unswayed by time; hearts grow fonder, sure, but metal rusts and shelves dust over, too.</p>\n",

The band makes such monumentally icy music that I can't imagine primary colors having anything to do with it-- this music is washed-out amber, fuzzy off-white, glimmering silver, lacking sharp contrast and exhalting the distances between sounds.</p>\n<p>It's an approach Auburn Lull have taken throughout their career, and it's yielded a body of work that could be easily criticized as homogenous-- indeed most people won't need more than one of their records. Without paying close attention, it's easy not to notice the passage of tracks and the subtle shifting of moods and textures, but that's also what makes this retrospective of the band's non-LP material so satisfying. The songs may be drawn from across a decade, but they have a shared aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Personalities of individual musicians are beside the point in this music. Guitars, bells, synths, even vocals and drums coalesce into a diaphanous whole where melodies move in languid waves and rhythm is often more subliminal than obvious. Take &quot;TI-99&quot;, for instance: Sean Heenan lays down a web of oscillator-generated drones, creating a billowy breath of a song whose textures are not terribly unlike the ones created with guitars elsewhere on the set.</p>\n<p>&quot;A Harbored Distance&quot; and &quot;Steady Light&quot; are more traditional songs, ground in reverb-soaked drums rhythms and straightforward vocal melodies, but both have that smeared Auburn Lull approach that draws everything hazily toward the other elements. &quot;Van Der Graaf&quot; has a slightly more metallic texture than its counterparts, a darker brushed steel tone that sets it slightly apart. The biggest stand-out, though, is &quot;Rural Divide&quot;, a stunning track that's among the band's best to date. Quite unlike most of the band's catalog, the song features a prismatic midsection that sets a muffled sample of a woman speaking amidst swirling somethings that sound like a cross between electric piano, Tomorrowland synths, and e-bowed guitars.</p>\n<p>Auburn Lull make a beautiful noise, and if you already have one of their albums and are looking for more, you'll love what you hear on this. It's also not a bad place to start, but I'd suggest for <em>Alone I Admire for that purpose. But</em> <em>Regions Less Parallel demonstrates how having a limited signature sound isn't necessarily a negative, so long as a band realizes the many places it can travel within those limits.</em></p>\n",

You start out as a caterpillar, of course, a furry little thing with a tent-like exoskeleton and too many legs, but before long, you're wrapped in your chrysalis, slowly morphing into something entirely different, more mature, and frequently beautiful. What I really think gives butterflies the edge over other species is that period of metamorphic hibernation-- during their most awkward phase, they're insulated from the world at large, and they still emerge with a new maturity. On the other extreme, when we're in our most awkward phase, adolescence, we're thrust into the hostile social grist mills we refer to as schools, and emerging with a new-found maturity on the other end is no sure bet. Some people emerge as adults, others just very large caterpillars.</p>\n<p>People really have nothing to compare to that chrysalis state, though certainly try hard to find it; Thoreau on Walden Pond, transcendental meditation, or even a teenager in that awkward phase hiding out in her room with the radio up to drown out thoughts and inquisitive parents seem to reach for it. To heighten the effect, that teenager might want to slip in <em>Cast from the Platform</em>, the sophomore effort from Lansing, MI's Auburn Lull, which is about as close as you can come, musically, to being wrapped in heavy gauze and closed in from the ugly detail revealed by harsh direct light.</p>\n<p>There is no awkwardness in the world the band creates on <em>Cast from the Platform</em>, only abiding grace and enveloping beauty. Even when they cast their tunnel of light drones and oceanic washes of guitar and synth texture across fractured rhythms, as they do on &quot;Season of False Starts&quot;, the flow of sound is too natural to be hobbled. &quot;Direction &amp; Destination&quot;, meanwhile, has all the weightless illumination of the Verve's debut EP or Bark Psychosis' &quot;I Know&quot;, Sean Heenan's rounded, seafoam (and suspiciously British-sounding) vocals drifting over Jason Weisinger's spacious drums through a cavern of water-formed reverb.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of album that will no doubt garner more than a few reviews that try to pin a shoegazer label to it, and just as many that try to call it &quot;space-rock&quot; or something similar, and that's a shame, because it's entirely too ascendant to deserve the first term, and too terrestrial and warm to warrant the second. &quot;Trenches&quot; may have guitars that could soundtrack a supernova, but that shuffling march beat keeps it firmly on the ground, while piano and dusty vocals render it human and evocative. The music's principle paradox is its expansiveness in spite of the intimacy of the recording-- it's the kind of thing that seems perfect for a rainy day alone inside with cats and books, but also makes me want to get out the maps and start planning routes to scenic places.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it's your choice when you listen to it; my role really only extends to imploring you to give it a go in the first place. Auburn Lull's musical cocoon is a wholly inviting one, melodic and gorgeously textured, uniform in sound, but with enough rhythmic and tonal variety to explode any accusations of monochromaticism. <em>Cast from the Platform</em> is an album you can immerse yourself in as deeply as you like, so step inside. You won't regret it.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Occasionally you'll come across a bandname that describes its aura more succinctly than you ever could. The 'Auburn Lull'-- that warm, radiant feeling that stays with you when your girlfriend's gone home, after a psychedelic trip or just a long, lazy day at the beach. It's an apt name for the musicians, who holed up between the summer of 1997 and the spring of 1998 and carved out the thick slabs of resonance that became <em>Alone I Admire</em>. The album was originally released in 1999 on Burnt Hair Records, the Michigan label known for drone excursions by groups like F\u00fcxa and Windy &amp; Carl, and it's been out-of-print since shortly thereafter. Darla was wise to secure the reissue: this is a classic, transcending notions of space-rock and shoegazing to reach an apotheosis of pure, vibrant sound.</p>\n<p>A massive amount of production work went into <em>Alone I Admire</em>, no doubt due in part to producer Andrew Prinz of Mahogany. The sleeve notes mention the array of microphones spread throughout the studio, centered especially around the drums to create a sensation of depth. The guitar signals were bi-amped for dense resolution, and &quot;it should be noted that several different kinds of sampling and delay units were utilized, as well as a gregarious amount of external reverberation processors.&quot; Afterwards the songs were enhanced by further editing and tape looping, and eventually fed into a 16-channel mixing desk. As a result, these slow songs evolve gently through some of the most eyelid-shudderingly rich sonic layers I've ever heard. Audiophiles will revel in a record that finally tests their systems to the limit.</p>\n<p>The group begins each track with a simple rhythmic idea, as with the steady cymbal tick that opens &quot;Stockard Drive.&quot; A sheet of sound rises up, instruments completely indistinguishable, just this sustained choral hum that builds as the male singer breathes a light refrain. Nothing prepares you for the burst that follows, though, as a searing ray that was once a guitar soars upwards into a gorgeous heliosphere. The timbres throughout <em>Alone I Admire</em> have you reaching sheepishly for embarrassing adjectives like 'glorious' or 'sacred.' There's an all-enveloping, alien perfection to the music that even some legendarily obsessive musicians couldn't quite craft.</p>\n<p>The Auburn Lull's success has to do somewhat with the minimal instrumentation they chose. Bass, guitar and drums are augmented by other strings and occasional tape loops and piano strains. &quot;Old Mission&quot; features the bowing of a cello, its solitary nature setting a melancholy counterpoint against the orchestral swell of guitars that follows. &quot;Blur My Thoughts&quot; brightens the mood as angelic pulse tones descend amongst the cavernous bass drum reverb, a constant shimmering that reminds me of Seefeel. That's one of the only comparisons necessary for these otherworldly atmospheres, though, and ethereal vocals intrude to draw you out of total reverie. A sample of foreign language chatter from the television ends the piece on a tense note.</p>\n<p>The album's careful to keep enough progressions in play to avoid floating away entirely. On &quot;Desert,&quot; the sheen of the guitar permeates the mix at first, chipped into recognizable form by the circling strokes of the percussion. Then a deep rhythm line rises, like dub played on double-bass, shifting the piece into forward motion. Again, the male/female vocal harmony chimes together like a psalm, and the lyrics (&quot;leave without a clue...&quot;) turn the title into a verb. But despite the utterly solemn moments on the album, it's striking how nice the melodies are overall. &quot;The Last Beat&quot; in particular heightens the pace with a faster drum shuffle, and the oscillating scree of the guitar brings peaceful images of seagulls gliding over shorelines. It's simply beautiful, uplifting music.</p>\n<p>Environments this pristine and patient inevitably get tagged as 'glacial,' but the Auburn Lull drift through spaces far more nebulous, like billowing clouds ringing mountaintops. Of course, some listeners might get lost in the haze, and there will be some who say that the album puts them to sleep. That's partly the point: whereas the rock-oriented shoegazer bands were content to coat their pop songs in cycles of distortion, the Auburn Lull finds an even more engrossing starting point deep within the decay of reverberation. You'll find yourself lulled by the swirling sounds, always spinning forward and yet echoing in the past's delay, caught up in the doldrums and realizing it's a lovely place to be. They may have recorded only one album, but the Auburn Lull have made music fine enough to die to, and I don't think I alone admire their ability to bring heaven to the earth.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Keep your Zelig analogies, I call it Sublime Syndrome. When bands emulate everything they consume, success becomes a matter of taste; all derivatives are not created equal, but some are born of nobler blood. Songs become vibes and everything gets somethingified. The albums that crib most fully and unabashedly testify not as suspects but as witnesses. Sometimes we get School of Rock grads, sometimes card-carrying exoticists. Sublime drank Corona with the dullest deities in both camps, but at least they were candid. The jury appreciated that.</p>\n<p>Worse than a poor choice of acquaintances is the extrovert's inability-- or unwillingness-- to discern at all. Surveying the 00s British house, garage, and pop schema, Audio Bullys find a lot they like. Too much, in fact. &quot;You just can't control it,&quot; claims the title track, apparently referring to Audio Bullys eclecticist impulse. <em>Generation</em> would sit much better if the group focused on something in particular, whether it be &quot;EQ'ing&quot;'s cartoonish big-beat bash, &quot;Shot You Down&quot;'s pivotal Nancy Sinatra vocals, or any of the other ideas scattered throughout. Imagine a <em>Since I Left You</em> sans principle and precision. It's okay to artfully muss hair, less so one's vinyl collection.</p>\n<p>A recent iPod double-bill backing <em>Generation with Ricardo Villalobos's <em>Ascho</em> did not do the Bullys any favors; Villalobos made brothers-in-scratch Tom Dinsdale and Simon Franks look about as subtle as the Bloodhound Gang. But Audio Bullys don't request attention, they irrupt into your headphones like a drunk at a curry house, usually bullhorning pep rally piffle like, &quot;You are now entering the mode of the Audio Bullys.&quot; Morally palatable as it is to hear a house record not dredged in fairy dust, <em>Generation</em> makes you appreciate ketamine's bottomless suction or space disco's eternal ascent. But Audio Bullys chase Bombay Sapphire, not white rabbits, tracing a pedestrian trajectory: It's all good 'till you puke or someone gets his nose hairs burnt.</em></p>\n<p><em>Generation</em> is a sonic mess, all weightless synth swish, dull beats, and maybe-ironic midi horns. Sample encyclopedias would be able to tag the ubiquitous chordal upbeats &quot;Bring Light&quot; hawks for a hook, but the watered-down post-Bangalter vibe comes across regardless. Then there's the rapping, so reliant on DJ phraseology, so devoid of the Skinner-trifles that can endear those clich\u00e9s, or at least make them sufferable. After Audio Bullys drop lyrical bombs, they light a match. Here's the wanly pneumatic &quot;Take You There&quot; to aerosol &quot;This Road&quot;'s odorous droppings. There's the chummy trumpet call &quot;Get Myself on Track&quot;, followed by a handful of fail-proof yet tacky love songs. &quot;Generation&quot;, meanwhile, with its globby lava lamp bassline and chintzy Reason drums, may need a longer soak. Here's an idea: Wait, there it went.</p>\n",

Like a great singer-songwriter with a lousy voice, like a pro-caliber basketball player who's only five feet tall, they're packed full of the right ideas but stuck fighting their own limitations. Actually, that's an outright lie, because they aren't fighting: if their limitations are a wall, it's just another surface they can slouch against, smoking cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Their debut single, after all, was called &quot;We Don't Care&quot;-- and if people heard punk in it, it was just that disregard for whether they were doing things right or not. They were. When the song took off in the UK, people suspected they could do many things. They could be the next Basement Jaxx, wrapping house music around a dozen genres-- rock, hip-hop, R&amp;B;, UK garage-- cranking out purified pop from their blender. They could be the next Streets, packing up a street-level vision of Brit boylife and mailing it out on bumping beats. They could christen a new genre-- &quot;hooligan house?&quot;</p>\n<p>All of this was just the usual exaggeration from getting very, very excited, but no one was out of line: &quot;We Don't Care&quot; sounds like a couple guys in gorilla suits taking house hostage. It starts with solo vocals, Simon Franks barking marble-mouthed like the Clash; then, before the house stomp comes in-- a big knuckle-dragging bruiser of a stomp, a beat that bounces in a way hardly anything but American hip-hop ever does-- the whole thing stops for the highlight, the barely-intelligible sneer: &quot;WHATHAFAA!&quot; I have notes on this track in front me, and after a bunch of stuff about hooliganism and the jaunty mid-song breakdown I have written: &quot;Oh my god. Oh man.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Ego War</em> sports a few singles this good or arguably better, and in each case it's down to two things: fantastic ideas and consistently great scripting by beat-dresser Tom Dinsdale. His music isn't exactly symphonic, but it's good-looking and inventive: constantly punchy, rough-and-tumble, sneakily switched-up house beats like overexcited puppies tripping over their own legs as they sprint over to lick you silly.</p>\n<p>Not to point fingers, but the problems lurk more in Franks's domain: if Americans already have problems with British people doing anything rap-like, Franks's occasional bouts of troglodytic rhyming aren't going to help matters. This doesn't have to kill things any more than punk singers killed punk-- in at least two places, it sort of helps-- but I have to mention the line, &quot;About a year I was with her for/ and when we broke it left me quite sore.&quot; It's another reason to feel bad for them, actually, because that clunker comes in a year when UK garage MCs have started looking even better than their hip-hop equivalents-- even Jay-Z's paying attention, and sometime soon, he'll see the release of a full-length from Dizzee Rascal, whose basement rant &quot;I Luv U&quot; walks all over &quot;We Don't Care&quot;. As for Franks, well...you're better off if you don't exactly need your pop stars to sound like scholars.</p>\n<p>Some winners: the title track, for which my notes go a step further and say &quot;holy god.&quot; You could dance to this super-sunny island bounce, but not without sporting a loopy grin at the situation, or at its intense Englishness: it's Madness; it's like the parks of <em>Parklife</em> got paved to put up discos. Or &quot;The Snow&quot;: Dinsdale's got a thing for punchy seventies horn sections, and this, their best house track, EQs them through dime-stop switchbacks while Franks lazes around the repeating melody. Or &quot;I Go to Your House&quot;, which struts and bumps like Stereo MCs and points the hey-there gun-fingers at you. This is one of those places where Franks's tossed-off babble enhances things: he goes to her house and she's not there, but it sounds like he really thinks that's her loss.</p>\n<p>When your M.O. is just a banged-up house pump and a less-than-stellar singer coasting over a few melody lines, anything less than the best has a tendency to grate: like the riff-repetition of the average Fall record, the winners win and the rest just sit there looking underplanned. It's the Day in the Life packaging that fails them more often: on The Streets' <em>Original Pirate Material</em>, Mike Skinner put on just the right two-face-- a garrulous wit one second, he'd go all emo-earnest on you the next, sounding sad, determined, and vulnerable. Franks tries the same, with less success-- on &quot;100 Million&quot; he sits around stoned while his mother yells at him to get a job, and &quot;Way Too Long&quot; offers a Skinnerian tale of bad debts among the geezers, but by &quot;The Things&quot; and &quot;Veteran&quot; he's promising to change his life and &quot;be a better man.&quot; In between you get Dinsdale playing with the beats a little: video-game tick-tock and synth-tweakery on &quot;Real Life&quot;, then a weirdo Halloween toy-robot bass-bump on &quot;The Tyson Shuffle&quot;; Joe Cocker samples alternate with music-hall piano on &quot;Face in a Cloud&quot;.</p>\n<p>They don't need to be &quot;great,&quot; really, because sometimes it's more important to get everything right; to be honest is often to be honestly great. And they are, In the rough crayon sketches of everything collapsing, of dance music being pop music being dance music again, of anyone singing and rapping the way anyone could shout for punk bands, of everything pumpable or shoutable or loveable collapsing into a hit-single playground. Still, crayon sketches: they're no Basement Jaxx, and it's easy to hope for someone with more professional skills to come fill in the Audio Bullys' blueprints.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Over his long, evolving career, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/\">Matthew Dear</a> has distinguished himself from\u00a0America\u2019s indie-electronic world through his outsized, wry personality and\u00a0absolute open-mindedness to pop, whether under his own name, or as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/250-audion/\">Audion</a>, his louche techno guise. Starting with his very first single (\u201cHands Up for Detroit,\u201d co-written by the late Disco D) through his first taste of \u201ccrossover\u201d success (his inaugural vocal turn on 2003\u2019s \u201cDog Days\u201d), he\u2019s never been afraid to make music that\u2019s both artful and catchy.</p>\n<p>Since relocating from Ann Arbor to the New York area in the mid-\u201900s, the music Dear\u2019s made has increasingly unshackled itself from genre, embracing wider ideas of song and rhythm, ending up somewhere in the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/\">Bowie</a>/<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/\">Talking Heads</a>/late-period <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/\">Depeche Mode</a> territory\u2014as \u201celectronic\u201d as it is \u201cindustrial\u201d and \u201cpost-punk\u201d and \u201cgoth,\u201d but really only adjacent to all of these. At the same time, he\u2019s never pretended to abandon dance-music, and\u00a0Audion has often served as the release of Dear\u2019s techno Id. In the dozen or so years he\u2019s been banging out lascivious and catchy tracks under that moniker, Dear has used it as a playground where hooks interact with techno\u2019s progressive sonic ideologies.</p>\n<p>Contradictory though it might at-first seem, \u201cfun-first minimalism\u201d has been Audion\u2019s <em>modus operandi</em> from the get-go. The keeper on the 2004 EP <em>Kisses</em> is called \u201cTitty Fuck,\u201d seven minutes of filters and percussion patterns piled upon a two-part skeletal hook that\u2019s driven into the ground until everyone in earshot\u2019s gone mental. Much of Audion\u2019s ensuing catalog turned that example into gospel (and set a tone for labels like Dirtybird): hard, repetitive dance tracks with a dirty-ish mind, a grimy sonic gleam attractive to both newbie ravers and\u00a0veterans, more funky earworms and hookup stimulants than philosophical tracts. Even Audion\u2019s release formats spoke to notions of pop immediacy, with the 2005 album debut <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/488-suckfish/\">Suckfish</a></em>\u00a0followed only by an army of singles (many not even pressed to vinyl for optimal legacy quotient), all featuring Will Calcutt\u2019s hypnotic designs.</p>\n<p>Another of Calcutt\u2019s trademark patterns adorns the cover of <em>Alpha</em>, but besides that, few things around Audion\u2019s long-gestating second album seem familiar\u2014not its soft-focus darkness, not its pensiveness, not the minimalism with the negligible payoff. Instead, <em>Alpha</em> sounds like the character that once recorded a nice throbbing jack entitled \u201cJust Fucking\u201d has curtailed his libido and dragged out his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/33330-jeff-mills/\">Jeff Mills</a> records for inspiration. (The most instantly magnetic one here, \u201cDestroyer,\u201d even has a title harkening back to one of Mills\u2019 classic Underground Resistance co-productions.) This is a wonderful conceit\u00a0but not the reason people come to Audion\u00a0in the first place, and leaves the album fighting a catalog\u2019s worth of pre-conceptions.</p>\n<p>Yet if <em>Alpha</em> means to reposition Audion\u2019s place in the world, it undersells this new perspective. The opener, \u201cDem,\u201d downplays its beat in favor of a dank, echo-laden horrorcore, excellently setting up a downcast tone, but then instantly veers into a conveyor belt of stripped-d0wn bangers. They are crisp and marvelously engineered, but the catchy bits are nowhere to be found. Tracks such as \u201cThere Was a Button\u201d and \u201cTraanc\u201d are acceptable as minimal-house DJ tools, but as greater parts of a long-playing whole, they seem lost for a broader context\u2014a context Dear previously had no trouble offering.</p>\n<p>Only at <em>Alpha</em>\u2019s tail end does Audion\u2019s (and Dear\u2019s) personality\u00a0assert itself.\u00a0The hook of \u201cZunk Synth\u201d is a grey-noise gurgle EQ\u2019d in and out of the fog, as synth-pads and a percussive varietal built on tambourines and hi-hats puddle around playfully. And \u201cSicko\u201d uses the album\u2019s brightest keyboard line, plus a 909 bass punch, to build-up to the album\u2019s biggest payoff, akin to the sound of an old-school disco dub. Unlike anything else from the prior hour, it closes the proceedings in wonderful style, Dear\u2019s sound of Audion remembered. One just wonders: Why did it take\u00a0so long?</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Audion is the static, dancefloor-oriented side project of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/\">Matthew Dear</a>. Conceived as a bawdy, voiceless take on Detroit techno and New York electro, it was introduced in the middle of the last decade to provide an outlet for Dear's baser desires, namely depictions of raunchy sex and electronic music freed from the need to sound artful or smart. <em>Audion X</em>, offered up 10 years after the release of Audion's sole album, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/488-suckfish/\"><em>Suckfish</em></a>, collects 18 tracks from Audion's dozen-plus EPs and that album, and adds two new tracks in anticipation of a sophomore LP, due later this year. Even-numbered anniversaries aside, it's a peculiar reclamation, as Audion records are not particularly influential or coveted. Neither is its style\u2014full-bodied machine funk\u2014resurgent at the moment.</p>\n<p>Dear's work as Audion stood out upon release in opposition to his work under his own name. Early albums <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2526-leave-luck-to-heaven/\"><em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em></a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10289-asa-breed/\"><em>Asa Breed</em></a> established Dear as a wunderkind of the micro-house style\u2014an understated, minimal take on techno famously championed by Cologne's Kompakt label. Dear has since proven himself something of a stylistic chameleon, eventually gravitating towards a celebrated electro-pop sound. He delivered some of his most compelling vocal work just last year as a foil to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/\">DJ Koze</a>, his &quot;<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16369-magical-boy-matthew-herbert-remix/\">magical boy</a>.&quot; Back in 2004, though, Audion was everything Matthew Dear was not: explicit, stoopid, forward. Extended club cuts such as &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Pong&quot; offered Dear a connection to the seminal Detroit techno sound (Dear spent part of his youth in Michigan) as well as to the rowdy electro on offer from tastemakers like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4236-tiga/\">Tiga</a> and DJ Hell.</p>\n<p>As Audion tracks are largely wordless mazes of rhythmic curlicues and farty bass noises, they earn the debauchery largely through their song titles. Titles like &quot;Just Fucking&quot; and &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot; feature. The sexiness might mean more to Dear than it does to us: his early work was nuanced and elegant to the point that you can imagine him producing a romping track like &quot;Titty Fuck&quot; and finding it sufficiently naughty so as to name it something like, well, &quot;Titty Fuck&quot;. Audion tracks aren't really about sex, or at least they're no more about sex than lots of other funky machine music. That's okay: sometimes foreplay is wine and movie, sometimes it's sweating next to someone until 4am.</p>\n<p>At present, Audion's sound is completely out of step with techno's prevailing trends, which favor harsh, industrial noise and dubby deconstructions. Audion tracks slave themselves to the groove: you won't remember specific drum patterns, and the hooks are short and repetitive so as to inspire maximum grinding. The tracks <em>feel</em> big. When &quot;It's Full of Blinding Light&quot; is careening around the room, you're not supposed to think of sound structure or art or music culture: you're supposed to wiggle. Tracks like &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Pong&quot; are excellent reminders of techno's debt to funk and its unwavering commitment to any riff, bassline, or hook that inspires movement. At its best, Audion offers a rowdier take on the Kompakt/minimal techno sound that ruled the aughts. It's a beefier, fleshier mix, not as slinky as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/\">Ricardo Villalobos</a> or as wily as DJ Koze, but brasher, harder, and dumber (by design).</p>\n<p>Despite a fetching sound and some killer tracks, <em>Audion X</em> doesn't have much of a story to tell, not even one of artistic progression. Banging, erotic club tracks are Audion's singular purpose, and <em>Audion X</em> offers 18 of them, spanning nearly two-and-a-half hours. Spacey, atmospheric excursions like &quot;I Am the Car&quot; can span nearly 10 minutes. Most of the offerings are uniform in tempo, mood, and function. And while <em>Audion X</em> will leave no Audion fan wanting, a bevy of potent remixes were largely ignored. <em>Audion X</em> seems timed to rekindle interest in the Audion project prior to a new album, so it's worth nothing that the two new tracks here\u2014&quot;Motormouth&quot; and &quot;Sky&quot;\u2014are excellent. The former, in particular, dices a vocal sample into a mental, infectious mess.</p>\n<p>Still, if the purpose of <em>Audion X</em> was to drum up interest, it may have the opposite effect. <em>Audion X</em> is all the Audion anyone will ever need\u2014twice as much, actually. Dear's work as Audion was limited by design, and <em>Audion X</em> repeatedly shoves those limits into your face. <em>Audion X</em> is a stylistic indulgence, for both its creator and its listeners.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's hard to get out of <em>Suckfish</em> once it's on. You're just suddenly in it, like a silver pinball shot into the screwy Op art lock groove of its cover. The prickly microhouse rhythms he brought to 2003's <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em> are still present, but as Audion Matthew Dear tops those stipples with synthesizers that growl and an attitude that says, &quot;Come on.&quot; With this record, the only thing you're supposed to do is get off. Oscillating tones pierce the beat repeatedly on opener &quot;Vegetables&quot;, and pretty soon there are manipulated voices in there too, mumbling alone in your mind. But that's just a preamble to the <em>Suckfish</em> thump of &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot; and &quot;Titty Fuck&quot;. There are elements of empty space in the former-- Dear snips off the bass except for right over the drum so the synths are like pointy elbows jutting into the open space on a dancefloor, and the effect is chilly. But if their titles didn't give it away these songs are pretty randy, too-- <em>Suckfish</em> is techno that tumbles towards ecstasy in 4/4 time.</p>\n<p>&quot;Your Place or Mine&quot; is cool, but it's &quot;Titty Fuck&quot; that's the real base desire provider, its slinky 22nd century disco beat flirting with a five-note melodic tickler until the whole thing swells to a hissing, gritty finale that's just unclean. Back alley sex = bad idea. But that's the feel Dear is going for with Audion, however detached and dirty it is. He wants you to envision having relations among machines, or maybe machines having relations; either way, he provides tracks like &quot;Kisses&quot; and &quot;The Pong&quot; to do it to. &quot;Pong&quot;'s primary tone thrusts and eases back, the inevitable give and take of a frantically dancing crowd in a dark basement room, and a howling bass line alternates with blasts of clattering rhythm and quieter moments that sound like pinging sonar.</p>\n<p>The calculated quality of <em>Suckfish</em> is part of its allure. Unlike Nympho, Armand Van Helden's recent foray into sexified disco-punk obviousness, Dear has specifically categorized &quot;Titty Fuck,&quot; the fluid, tense &quot;Uvular&quot;, and the rest as being separate from himself. (You won't see something like the blatant &quot;Just Fucking&quot; on <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em>'s follow-up.) Releasing them under an alias allows Dear to position this material as a separate project, a grand design to get you laid. And the designer? Audion, which doesn't sound the least bit human and instead suggests a faceless superintelligent robot or hard plastic nub that will exude soothing &quot;penetration sounds&quot; in some Huxley sex parlor of the future. This is opposite to Van Helden's all too manmade and selfish approach, like bad cologne and worse drugs versus the sleek lines of <em>Suckfish</em>, the sex toy prototype.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If you've ever listened to Bach's <em>Goldberg Variations</em> and thought, &quot;Pretty cool; could use some hot beats,&quot; then you're going to love Aufgang. They blend pianos, live drums, and techno-inspired electronics into invigorating displays of virtuosity, which evoke the club and the conservatory without really belonging to either one. (Their name is German for &quot;stairway&quot;-- an intermediate place, neither here nor there.) Given to singing out ecstatically, Aufgang's self-titled debut highlights the emotional extravagance these two different worlds have in common. It sounds kind of posh on paper, but it's actually really buoyant and fun. It always makes me picture an anthropomorphic grand piano in an old Warner Bros. cartoon, bouncing on rubbery legs to its own irrepressible music.</p>\n<p>We're not talking about indie rockers pasting a few major thirds and fifths onto a preset. This is serious piano playing. Rami Khalif\u00e9 and Francesco Tristano both trained at Julliard. Khalif\u00e9 is the son of Lebanese composer Marcel Khalif\u00e9, and Tristano is well-regarded for his recorded repertoire (which includes <em>The Goldberg Variations</em>, in fact). Drummer Aymeric Westrich contributes a lively yet understated attack, somewhere between the four-on-the-floor throbs of house and rock music.</p>\n<p>Aufgang's dual education, in the nightclub and the academy, shows in the historical and stylistic range of their music. &quot;Barock&quot; is baroque, while &quot;Channel 7&quot; (which has already been winningly remixed by John Talabot) pays homage to DJ Rolando's &quot;Knights of the Jaguar&quot; with wave after wave of divebombing trills courtesy of Westrich, whose cinematic loops add drama to many tracks. Blindingly happy piano playing fills in for swept strings, like Schroeder from &quot;Peanuts&quot; riding a huge caffeine rush. You can tell they've studied their Satie, Glass, Bart\u00f3k, Prokofiev, etc., but their music doesn't feel much like a master's thesis. It's earnest and rapturous, gliding elaborately in fast, intelligible currents.</p>\n<p>Usually, at least. If you expect heat from every track, then <em>Aufgang</em> is far from a perfect album-- the songs are deeply contrasted, with almost no middle ground between the thunderclaps and long, sullen rumbles. Only &quot;3 Vitesses&quot; really explores that broad middle range of intensity, with insistently ticking drums and sharp-cornered, diabolical piano intervals that continually dodge comfortable resolution. For attention-grabbers, you've basically got &quot;Channel 7&quot; and &quot;Barock&quot;; &quot;Sonar&quot;, which has the album's most sure-footed build-up; &quot;Good Generation&quot;, where rolling, 1970s-sounding pianos blur into sparkly electro; and &quot;Aufgang&quot;, which admits a little rowdy acid into the mix.</p>\n<p>At the other extreme, &quot;Prelude Du Pass\u00e9&quot; crawls at a glacial pace, and &quot;Soumission&quot; closes the album with over 10 minutes of dissonant, decaying chords. It can be hard to get all the way through that one, knowing that the unstoppable &quot;Channel 7&quot; is about to wrap around. But the more austere tracks underscore something good about Aufgang. They don't just charge straight for the rafters; they pause, reconsider, begin again. They ask the listener to flip back and forth between patience and euphoria on cue, over and over. For those willing to do so, the gemlike clarity of the album's peaks feel even harder and brighter.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Of all the people in the world that would intentionally choose a vacation to Jamaica, I never imagined that Mom and Bruce would. But they did go-- not to Trenchtown, to one of those nice resorts near the Jamaican golf course. Did they have a good time? &quot;Everyone expects a handout down there, they all want money,&quot; they laughed. &quot;'Aye mon,' all holding out their hands, 'Jammin,' mon.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Since a request for killer collie from these cultural ambassadors was out of the question, I asked them to bring me back a melodica. I packed her a picture of Augustus Pablo for reference and tried to explain how, using a plastic child's toy, he had produced some of the most beatific breaths ever imbibed by the ears, leading folks as disparate as Tortoise, Damon Albarn, and Pole to send their mums out for one as well.</p>\n<p>Initial concerns about the interchangeability between tracks faded away as I let this latest culling of rare sides spin, endlessly. Instead I was struck by the truth of possibilities that come to the fore. Put together by the British reggae reissue label Pressure Sounds (also responsible for last year's equally exquisite Pablo set, <em>El Rockers</em>), these side by side tracks showcase the playing of Pablo and a pool of folks like the Barrett Brothers, &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith, and Robbie Shakespeare, laying out in consecutive versions a phenomenon that even Shr\u00f6dinger could get with: each version of a riddim splits into different realities, elucidated on apiece by the players in their dubs.</p>\n<p>It opens up with five different versions of &quot;Far East&quot;, done under such interchangeable names as Pablo All Stars and Rockers All Stars. The first one focuses on the melodica, allowing it to move through the brass section laconically. In &quot;Phillip's Showcase&quot;, the brass head gets dropped soon after the opening, and the pumping organs of bass and drum are revealed in all their pulsing glory; returning later as &quot;East Man Sound&quot;, there are extra percussive shakes and a quivering keyboard that warps the melody beautifully, leading into even more-- you guessed it-- melodica. The fourth version drops in more hi-hat and cavernous rattles, before cutting into a more Hi-Fi take midway through, weaving another Pablo solo into the expanding guitar and organ.</p>\n<p>Then there's the stretch of Jah Levi's &quot;False Rumour&quot;, &quot;Zambian Style&quot; by Rockers All-Stars, and the &quot;Rockers Rock (Version)&quot; by Jah Iny near the end of the disc. The DJ on the first cut is heavily Rastafarian in theme, but his voice gets reverberated on the follow-up, the rhythm permeating the mix, making everything shake with low frequencies. Everything is tweaked beyond recognition on the last version, as Pablo switches up the bass line, stretches the organ like salty taffy, and has the tape-rewind run through an ever-shifting echo that destabilizes their dub into a new element. It's the most overtly weird slice here, the concentration being more on Pablo's touch behind the boards as well as in front of the microphone.</p>\n<p>But to only view the surface of Pablo's music is to miss out on the fact that beneath the seeming simplicity of three minute instrumentals lies a complex set of relationships, between the drum and bass, the stabs of organ and yardbird guitar, the temporal space between each hit, and how his serpentine lines on melodica and/or organ slide about on waves of probability, leaving ripples in the ether. For its limited scope, this is not a bad souvenir of the man.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The past year has seen a wider\u00a0move towards\u00a0the\u00a0genre of \u201c<a href=\"https://catacalypto.wordpress.com/2016/04/13/possibilities-in-the-tinyutopias-if-jam/\">tiny utopias</a>\u201d: small, invented idylls that, unlike the colossal world reconfigurations common in speculative fiction, are built to human scale. Whether polemic or meditative, they share a vision: a world better than our own and also within reach. It is, of course, obvious why one might want this now, might long to crawl out of this orange apocalypse and into a utopia. Art might not, as the myth goes, get better during bleak times, but bleak times do make people cling harder to the art they\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>Electronic artist Katie Stelmanis has always made political art, blatantly or subtly, from her time with riot grrl band Galaxy to her more muted project, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29292-austra/\">Austra</a>. But since 2013\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18195-austra-olympia/\">Olympia</a></em>, politics have gotten more, well, urgent. Stelmanis is Canadian and wrote *Future Politics *before the election results and before fascism started winning, but the album\u2019s Inauguration Day release is now looming, inescapable subtext. \u201cI was kind of worried it wouldn\u2019t be something that people would be interested in, or connect to... [but it\u2019s] become more relevant than I could\u2019ve ever imagined,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/schedule-for-monday-january-16-2017-1.3933467/how-science-fiction-helped-austra-s-katie-stelmanis-craft-future-politics-1.3933470\"> she told CBC</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Future Politics</em> doesn\u2019t depart from Austra\u2019s sound so much as filter it. Stelmanis\u2019 band, and its sound, are pared down, producing straightforward, minimal music akin to club artists like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VUuYSSvusE\">\u00a0Marie Davidson</a> or<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIHtLz5hgT8\"> Kate Wax</a>, or perhaps <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/\">Bj\u00f6rk</a>\u2019s electronic work. Even Stelmanis\u2019 voice, capable of great force, sounds less operatic than deliberately hollowed-out, as in the tentative melodies of \u201cBeyond a\u00a0Mortal\u201d and \u201cGaia\u201d or the collapsing coloratura of \u201cI\u2019m a Monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Austra fills the extra space by surfacing the themes formerly held in the band\u2019s subtext, though\u00a0occasionally stated, like *Olympia\u2019*s \u201cI Don't Care (I\u2019m a Man).\u201d While writing this album, Stelmanis was into science fiction and political manifestos\u2014in particular, the<a href=\"http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/\"> Accelerationist Manifesto</a> and Marge Piercy\u2019s canonical <em>Woman on the Edge of Time,</em> a novel whose utopian visions reach its main character amid abuse and institutional detention. \u201cIt needed to have a purpose other than just my own ego,\u201d Stelmanis said. And while <em>Future Politics</em> isn\u2019t impersonal\u2014throughout it\u00a0runs an undercurrent of loss, partly the result of personal and professional departures in Stelmanis\u2019 life\u2014the album concerns itself primarily with the dark side of \u201cthe personal is political,\u201d the slow parallel rot of self-contained\u00a0depression and political turmoil. When the definition of disordered thinking resembles, so closely and measurably, a world increasingly disordered and unmoored from fact, what do you even do? How do you think? How do you begin to conceive a way out?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fitting that the first track of the album is a question: \u201cWhat if we were alive?\u201d Stelmanis sings over synth pads and unsettled chords, like closing credits for a bittersweet ending. \u201cFreepower,\u201d like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MbqXOPmImA\"> its near-namesake</a>, presents a twitchy, unsettled mix and a plea for the personal. The title track is a driving sequencer track shaped like an anthem, but gets only as far as a battle cry: \u201cfuture politics.\u201d There\u2019s still mourning in the present to get past, after all, and the midsection of the album dwells upon it. \u201cI\u2019m a Monster\u201d begins like the bridge of a club track, the sort with tears-on-the-dancefloor and throbbing backing vocals, but where that track would provide release, there\u2019s only hollowness: \u201cI don\u2019t feel nothing anymore.\u201d \u201cGaia\u201d dwells upon loss as well; the track most reminiscent of Bj\u00f6rk, it\u2019s like a cut from a less optimistic *<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/\">Biophilia</a>**, *where the environment\u2019s full of more death than life.</p>\n<p>Despite all this, *Future Politics *is essentially an optimistic album, and presents solutions. First: self-care is important. \u201cDeep Thought,\u201d a minute-long, a cappella harp palpitation at the end of the record, is reminiscent of<a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/track/2mGC77CjEfSVf9FiltpXX3?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open\"> dream pop</a> or chillout, or even ASMR\u2014soothing genres. Second: make connections. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me to write in a major key,\u201d Stelmanis said (partly in jest) while touring <em>Olympia</em>, but \u201cI Love You More Than You Love Yourself\u201d accomplishes this musically and metaphorically, taking an idea last seen in dull<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crrOl0egI00\"> dance backfill</a> and turning it into an ode to redemptive love. \u201cUtopia\u201d has the album\u2019s lushest arrangement, a whirlwind of chiming trance synths, cheery octaves and airy background vocals, and its most indomitably romantic lyric: \u201cI only want to hold your hand my own damn life/I can picture a place where everyone feels it too.\u201d It\u2019s got the highest notes and most triumphant melodies of the album. It\u2019s music to be escaped into, whether on dance floors or alone somewhere, filled with a little less despair.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><em>Olympia</em> has been tipped as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/29292-austra/\">Austra</a>'s &quot;dance album,&quot; though the Toronto band's debut,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15434-feel-it-break/\">Feel It Break</a></em>, contained enough club-worthy material: the arpeggiating likes of &quot;Beat and the Pulse&quot;, and B-sides &quot;Energy&quot; and &quot;Young and Gay&quot; much more so. Its remixes came off less like mandatory singles life extensions than a glimpse into what these gothy tracks got up to\u00a0<em>after</em> the witching hour. On\u00a0<em>Olympia</em>, the main change from\u00a0<em>Feel It Break</em> isn't adding beats but adding more in general: the core trio doubled to a six-piece, bringing more layers to Katie Stelmanis' songwriting, and pushing it in a more house-inspired synth-pop direction.</p>\n<p>It's an obvious-seeming move these days, but Austra was close enough to this sound previously that it's not too jarring a development. Plus, they push in that direction with an unusual sonic palette:\u00a0sparkly harp solos, deadpan early-<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/\">Knife</a> riffs, vocals that sound druidic, even guttural, including New Age-evoking morose choral drones. Much continues to be made of Stelmanis's opera training, but opera's just about the only sound that\u00a0<em>isn't</em>\u00a0represented here.\u00a0It takes a while to get familiar with these sounds, which seems deliberate. &quot;You'll never know me, I'll never know you,&quot; as Stelmanis sings on &quot;Sleep&quot;, outright repudiating the notion of instant dancefloor connection.</p>\n<p>Stelmanis' solo work would turn single lines-- &quot;be your own company,&quot; &quot;join us&quot;-- into manifestos, a tendency for studies on a single riff that carried through into\u00a0<em>Feel It Break</em>.\u00a0<em>Olympia</em> sounds far more expansive and a little less removed-- &quot;We Become&quot; even grooves. Though opener &quot;What We Done?&quot; has the bass throb and synth counterpoint of a late-night dance hit, it doesn't do\u00a0much else, and vocalist Katie Stelmanis sings her melody as if what she's hearing is a requiem. &quot;Annie (Oh Muse, You)&quot;, the noisiest, synth-clappingest track here, mutters where there might have been melodies. Lead single &quot;Home&quot; is built on a house piano riff any of today's revivalists would envy, but it takes its sweet time getting there.</p>\n<p>Stelmanis has said she listened to a lot of early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/\">Cat Power</a> while recording <em>Olympia</em>, and while nothing here sounds anywhere near as stark, the lyrics often do, and lead appropriately tense, nervy sounding songs.\u00a0There are still hints of\u00a0<em>Feel It Break</em>'s aesthetic-heavy mysticism, but in general, <em>Olympia</em> is an album where a title like &quot;You Changed My Life&quot; is the sort to be delivered over sincere piano. (Over a low-end-heavy chug, but still.) &quot;Forgive Me&quot;, a plea to an estranged lover or friend, is blunt both lyrically (&quot;What do I have to do to make you forgive me?&quot;) and musically: obsessive, pinprick-tense, desperate for closure. &quot;Home&quot; has a similar centerpiece-- &quot;you know that it hurts me when you don't come home at night&quot;-- and the arrangement <em>sounds</em> like the feverish, sleepless worry that accompanies.</p>\n<p>Much of\u00a0<em>Olympia</em> is disarmingly personal, and some, as usual with Austra, is political-- but not the stuff of Stelmanis and drummer Maya Postepski's previous riot grrl band Galaxy, nor the cinemascope revolution of <em>Shaking the Habitual</em> (another cited inspiration) but something subtler. Throughout <em>Olympia</em>, love is a radical act and heartbreak-- in greater supply here-- a failure of community; but the album doesn\u2019t speak in those abstractions. \u201cPainful Like\u201d addresses bigotry, specifically anti-gay (\u201cWe don\u2019t have to marry\u2026. In this town we\u2019ll bury all the minds that clench too tight\u201d), but makes its point through quick flashes of detail (\u201cbruised skin on top of mine\u201d), a startling, candid sort of intimacy <em>Olympia</em>\u2019s remaining tracks grasp for.</p>\n<p>Later on comes the album's centerpiece &quot;I Don't Care (I'm a Man)&quot;, the most fuck-off title Austra's ever written, but the track has no dramatics, just a coolly dispassionate gaze. Stelmanis plays something between a satisfied troll and a coroner surveying the third crime scene of the day, monotone while detailing &quot;the whimper in her sigh, the softer brutalizing-- but I don't care, I'm a man.&quot; It barely lasts a minute, as if about to break into something more bracing; but the group's going not for shock but shrug value, the sort that gets disturbing once you process what you've just heard. This, it turns out, might be Austra's greatest strength.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>On her own and under her own name, Katie Stelmanis used to record synthetic art-pop. This was tense and jarring music, music that jumped around and demanded attention. Austra, Stelmanis' new band, makes just as much use of her stretched-out yip and her theatrical instincts, but the music is a lot warmer and more comfortable. Austra play a warm, hazy sort of electro-goth. It's synthetic and repetitive, and there's plenty of Giorgio Moroder in its DNA, but it's not dance music. Instead, it's music for a planetarium, or maybe for a mid-1980s PBS science documentary. Austra's synth riffs don't pound or undulate; they flutter and envelop. And Stelmanis doesn't sing over the top of their tracks; she emits sound from somewhere in the thick of it.</p>\n<p><em>Feel It Break</em>, Austra's debut album, is essentially made up of 11 minor variations on a single sound-- no complaint, since they're good at that one sound. It's tough to talk about Stelmanis' icy, high-pitched deadpan delivery without mentioning Kate Bush. By that same token, it's tough to talk about the band's music without mentioning <em>Witching Hour</em>-era Ladytron, or maybe Bat for Lashes. This is pretty and heady music, music that can subtly change the air in the room where it's playing. Drums lightly percolate rather than thud, and synth riffs hide inside each other like Russian nesting dolls, gradually revealing themselves over the course of entire songs. And the group builds these things patiently. Often, it holds back on introducing vocals or drums for more than a full minute, letting the songs' feel develop before making any radical changes.</p>\n<p>These songs aren't entirely alike. First single &quot;Beat and the Pulse&quot; has a telescoping sort of push-pull to it; it's the closest the band ever comes to genuine dance music, and even it doesn't come that close. On &quot;Lose It&quot;, Stelmanis gets a chance to stretch her huge, tremulous voice over some minimally invasive synth backing, and she sounds titanic: &quot;Don't wanna <em>loooooose</em> ya.&quot; The bouncy art-pop piano on &quot;Shoot the Water&quot; has a certain twitchiness, bringing Stelmanis partway back to her solo days. And closing tracks &quot;The Noise&quot; and &quot;The Beast&quot; do away with percussion entirely, letting Stelmanis sing over miasmic synth fog on the former and floridly ghostly piano on the latter.</p>\n<p>Even with those variations, though, <em>Feel It Break</em> still works as a monochromatic album, one content to stick with the same shade of glimmering darkness. Onstage at SXSW a couple of months ago, Austra cut a stark figure-- Stelmanis backed by two stunning, harmonizing twins, the rest of the band half-hidden at the back of the stage. Even playing in the middle of an absurdly sunny day, the band seemed to exist in some vague state of perpetual glamorous nighttime; that could've been them, not Bauhaus, serenading David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve during the great opening scene of Tony Scott's otherwise bullshit vampire movie, <em>The Hunger</em>. On <em>Feel It Break</em>, they've got that creeping cinematic synth-psych style down cold. Moving forward, I'm curious to hear what else they can do.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Autarkic is the name for Tel Aviv-based producer Nadav Spiegel, a solo\u00a0electronic act and\u00a0one of the more promising artists\u00a0in\u00a0the city\u2019s revived electronic scene, along with the likes of Red Axes and Moscoman. The latter released Autarkic\u2019s mini-LP <em>Can You Pass the Knife?</em> last year on his Disco Halal label, their first release of original productions after a series of Middle Eastern-tinged disco edits. It showed the young producer straddling house, coldwave, electro, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/\">Depeche Mode</a>-style synth-pop, and the like, keeping the proceedings just sullied enough.</p>\n<p>Now Spiegel follows that up with his nine-track debut LP. As both its title and cover image of a cigarette stubbed out in a cupcake suggest, Spiegel is conflicted when it comes to love. Conceived as a documentation and remedy for a recent heartbreak, the album reveals Spiegel\u2019s angst, mistrust, spite, and\u2014like any good romantic\u2014willingness to go through the wringer all over again by album\u2019s end.</p>\n<p>\u201cNew Heimat\u201d features squalls of guitar feedback, churning bass, and distorted hi-hats topped by Spiegel\u2019s strangulated vocals; it resembles a post-punk band rather than a producer behind some gear. Spiegel repeats the refrain \u201chome is where the hatred is\u201d until the words start to fray. But is he speaking of \u201chome\u201d in the domestic or national sense? With such lines\u00a0as \u201cNo more fighting for the state/No more bleeding for some faith,\u201d home sounds like\u00a0the last place he wants to be.</p>\n<p>The track then segues into the bent synths of \u201cViolence.\u201d Closed hi-hats and shaken bells rattle about the slinking disco bass, reminiscent at times of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/\">LCD Soundsystem</a>\u2019s \u201c45:33.\u201d It\u2019s here, though, that Spiegel\u2019s lines start to fall flat. \u201cEnvy/It\u2019s not good,\u201d he deadpans, and then draws on a couple\u2019s line of argument (\u201cIt\u2019s not about you\u201d). But he fails to do much with either thought. The terse and glowering \u201cHow to Cheat\u201d again finds the production in fine form, but Spiegel\u2019s lyrics make it feel like a rant, like a friend whose chat about his ex turns from therapeutic to bitter. Petty and overly dramatic, he sings of sodomizing the mind, money, and sex, to where his temper makes the words verge on incoherence.</p>\n<p>All of which makes \u201cGibberish Love Song\u201d the most effective track here, as\u00a0Spiegel opts for catchy bits of nonsense rather than embittered lines. A siren-like tone widens into a brooding banger. When the words do return, it\u2019s for a mumbling <em>kosmische</em> take on <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/\">Guided by Voices</a>\u2019 \u201cThe Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory,\u201d a curious cover to slot in the middle of the LP. It\u2019s a curveball that\u00a0doesn\u2019t quite land, but it proves Spiegel\u2019s penchant for going leftfield.</p>\n<p>\u201cBongos &amp; Tambourines\u201d smears Spiegel\u2019s voice across a clanging beat of bells and marimba. The analog keys suggest early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/\">Cluster</a>, but again the words feel clumsy with\u00a0Spiegel\u2019s pitchy delivery of \u201cBankers and robbers got hit by a cowbell/Bankers and robbers got hit by a snare.\u201d Closer \u201cWarmth (How Mean Is Mean?)\u201d bears the album\u2019s keenest melody courtesy of a violin playing a Middle Eastern scale as Spiegel sings of \u201cthe weirdest desire,\u201d hinting that he may once again utter \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Looped hand percussion and echoing chimes give \u201cWipe the Shame\u201d a slightly different feel. But it\u2019s this\u00a0song that makes one wonder if the album is really about a failed relationship or else an ultimately untenable nation-state. Is Spiegel singing of love or something more oppressive when he delivers lines like, \u201cBrutal oppress as self-defense... How can we take that man down\u201d? There\u2019s a kernel of protest to be had here, but it would resonate deeper\u00a0with stronger lines and more assured delivery.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>The past few years have been both a bounty and something of an endurance test for <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/\">Autechre</a> fans. This past May, the duo of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/11808-rob-brown/\">Rob Brown</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/11807-sean-booth/\">Sean Booth</a> released <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/\">elseq 1-5</a></em>, over four hours of new material. It earned comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/19091\">dumping off a bag of clothes at a second hand store</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/\">a Netflix show binge</a>. That followed on the heels of last year\u2019s AE_LIVE, which was over nine hours of live shows and 2013\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17691-autechre-exai/\">Exai</a></em>, which ran for two hours (though still under the length of a modern superhero film). It sounds daunting\u2014and yes, what the duo conjures up <em>sounds</em> daunting\u2014as Autechre is shorthand for a type of difficult strain of electronic music once deemed \u201cintelligent dance music.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance the word \u201calgorithm\u201d will be used when writing about their music, and despite their longevity, they remain at the vanguard, the <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/\">Cecil Taylors</a> of their field.</p>\n<p>But for all that impenetrability, there's a lifelong friendship and dialogue that takes place between the two, regardless of the fact they now live in separate cities, building and swapping MAX patches from a distance. It\u2019s a dialogue begun back in the late \u201880s, when they were electro-obsessed teens coming up in Manchester, swapping ideas and tracks on cassette tapes, jamming on analog synths and drum machines in their flats. It\u2019s a dialogue that you can parse on their earliest albums, <em>Incunabula</em>\u00a0and <em>Amber</em>, finally reissued on vinyl after they\u2019ve changed hands online for three-digit sums. That complex and private language is evident from the start, situating Brown and Booth as the <a href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/poto_and_cabengo\">Poto and Cabengo</a> of techno.</p>\n<p>\u201cEggshell,\u201d from their 1993 debut\u00a0<em>Incunabula</em>*,* subtly reworks \u201cThe Egg,<em>\u201d</em> a track\u00a0from the epochal <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/\"><em>Artificial Intelligence</em> comp</a> that forever saddled them with the \u201cintelligent dance music\u201d tag . The\u00a0<em>Incunabula</em> track locates a purgatory between the graffiti-friendly snare and hi-hats and disarmingly gorgeous, slow-moving synth line that evolves almost without notice behind the beat. The landscapes they evoke can seem post-industrial and dystopian, but the chord progression of \u201cKalpol Introl\u201d still feels melancholic and definitely <em>human</em>. And while its approximately 75-minute length is unwarranted\u2014the acid squelches of \u201cWindwind\u201d exhaust with\u00a0their 11-minute runtime\u2014there are both time-stamped presets as well as plenty of clues as to their evolution embedded in the album.</p>\n<p>An early highlight, \u201cBike,\u201d finds Autechre at their most songful, the bolts-on-concrete sounds of the 808s giving way to a beautiful ambient passage before that metallic\u00a0beat returns. Even odder is \u201cBasscadet,\u201d a fan-favorite hit of sorts back in 1994. Built from what sounds like a hand drum tattoo and featuring a cheeky vocal sample saying \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea \u2018bout what\u2019s going on,\u201d it features the abrasive electronic tones and scoured-metal aesthetic that would soon become the keystone to their future work.</p>\n<p>Next year\u2019s <em>Amber</em> might most closely resemble <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/\">Aphex Twin</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/\">Selected Ambient Works 85-92</a></em>, but even then it shows them subtly begin to slide away from their techno roots. Some of their most ambient tracks are here, though it also finds them favoring darker, more industrial timbres that earned those early <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/\">Cabaret Voltaire</a> comparisons. It\u2019s still disarming to see them use real words like \u201cGlitch\u201d and \u201cMontreal\u201d rather than the semantic jumble that would soon define their tracks. \u201cFoil\u201d builds with a beat that sounds like a whip against the titular material, the turbid washes decidedly more malicious than on their debut. The synth melodies of \u201cSlip\u201d haven\u2019t aged very well, and the sharper aspects of \u201cGlitch\u201d and \u201cPiezo\u201d feel dulled and gentle in hindsight, knowing just what nasty and brutish sounds they would soon wring out of their gear.</p>\n<p>What makes <em>Amber</em> fascinating to revisit decades on is to hear vestigial organs and sonic cul-de-sacs that Autechre would bin almost immediately after. Brown would look back and deem these melodic bits \u201c<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6788-autechre/\">cheesy</a>\u201d\u00a0but if anything, it proves that at one point the duo was human after all. \u201cSilverside\u201d might be Autechre\u2019s most haunted five minutes, even if the surge of orchestral soundtrack strings and distorted voice are two tricks that we\u2019d never hear again. \u201cNine\u201d might be the closest they ever got to the placid sounds of new age while \u201cFurther,\u201d with its slow heaving minor key swells are as emotive as anything Autechre ever released. The flickering lullaby melody and spare pads of \u201cYulquen\u201d reveal a soft, contemplative side that few could even identify as an Autechre track.</p>\n<p>With 1995\u2019s <em>Tri Repetae</em>, Autechre obliterated all that they\u2014and most of their Warp roster mates\u2014had done before. Rather than cut away vestigial parts, they scoured off\u00a0all flesh and \u201ccheesy\u201d bits entirely, trash-compacted their hard drives and went full cyborg instead. While Aphex Twin used a dentist drill-high frequency to wheeze atop his single <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fa-8GsMhznc\">\u201cVentolin\u201d</a> earlier that year, Autechre made it their entire aesthetic, reconfiguring each component of their productions with that same level of sonic intensity. From the deep, sawing sinewave and rockslide of low tones that open \u201cDael\u201d to the metallic thrums and chilling hiss of closer \u201cRsdio,\u201d <em>Tri Repetae</em> served as Autechre\u2019s superhero origin story, revealing a monstrous new power while also obliterating any trace of their previous selves. Rather than be able to trace the twisted metal of <em>Tri Repetae</em> to old Detroit techno singles and Mantronik sides, the lineage goes directly to <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/\">Merzbow</a>\u2019s white-knuckle noise and the hammered metal of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/\">Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten</a>. They\u2019d push into more experimental and complex music for the next twenty years and never quite be as gentle or linear as those first two efforts.</p>\n<p>The pewter sleeve bereft of any markings, the images of metal shafts and casings suggest that the humans behind Autechre were replaced not with robots but rather old radiators instead. Since then, experimental and dance artists alike\u2014be they on labels like PAN, Tri Angle or Editions Mego\u2014have absorbed certain aspects of Autechre\u2019s sound. Whether you go for <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/\">Arca</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/\">Holly Herndon</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28070-russell-haswell/\">Russell Haswell</a>, or <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/31448-powell/\">Powell</a>, they inhabit a world that Autechre helped make conceivable, so that even the cold metallic tones of their third album have somehow warmed with time. The bass growl that lurches forth on \u201cClipper\u201d now feels triumphant rather than menacing, the whinnying frequencies of \u201cRotar\u201d slowly tease out a melodic line. The spaceship vibrations of \u201cEutow\u201d bears a low-rider beat at its center and the factory clatter of \u201cGnit\u201d still reveals something quirky behind all the machinations. Revisiting\u00a0<em>Tri Repetae</em> twenty-one years later is like returning to\u00a0a planet previously filled with sulfuric acid clouds, volcanoes and liquid mercury pools. A hostile, post-human sound at the time of its release, it\u2019s now startling to find residents living and thriving there.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Arriving in a month thick with surprise album releases from A-listers like Beyonce, Drake, James Blake, and Radiohead, Autechre\u2019s\u00a0<em>Elseq</em>\u00a0might not surpass its peers in terms of buzz or anticipation. But it has definitely got them beat in sheer volume. The five-part series\u2014which was posted to the UK-based electronic duo\u2019s webstore last week\u2014adds up to more than four hours of music, out-clocking its peers by a significant margin. Taken at once,\u00a0<em>Elseq 1-5</em>\u00a0is a mammoth hunk of listening, the IDM equivalent of a Netflix series binge. It is twice the length of Autechre\u2019s last\u2014and previously, lengthiest\u2014album, 2013\u2019s\u00a0<em>Exai</em>.</p>\n<p>Musically, the collection seems to advance the argument for Autechre as a sort of post-human jam band, with members Rob Brown and Sean Booth improvising at length within an opaque world of custom-designed music software. Free from the limitations of a physical format (there is currently no CD or vinyl release planned for\u00a0<em>Elseq</em>), Autechre are free to sprawl and wander. And wander they do. <em>Elseq</em> <em>1-5</em> are as heady and frustrating as anything the duo have ever released. In some stretches, the music is glacial and serene (\u201ceastre\u201d). In others, the Brown and Booth\u2019s violent squelches suggest machine-on-machine violence in the spirit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_Research_Laboratories\">Survival Research Laboratories</a> (\u201cc7b2\u201d). Absorbing the whole thing requires a bit of commitment. Or maybe it just takes a giant bag of weed and a lot of free time. Thankfully,\u00a0<em>Elseq</em>\u00a0is also available to purchase in installments.</p>\n<p>Active since the late \u201980s, Autechre\u2019s early full-lengths\u2014<em>Amber</em>, *Tri Repetae\u2014*could be more clearly understood in the context of dance music, as the duo relied on similar hardware, like drum machines and analog synthesizers. Even still, their output has always embraced and amplified electronic music\u2019s eerie otherness. \u201cWe had heard these Latin Rascals edits with these fast bits with drums that sounded weirdly robotic, taking electro into this other zone,\u201d Booth<a href=\"https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/autechre-is-still-more-post-human-than-you-are\"> told Thump</a> last fall. \u201cHalf of the tracks that we do as Autechre are about recreating the actual sensations I used to get from those things\u2014just getting post-human and next level.\u201d As the years have passed, the duo\u2019s music has become ever more idiosyncratic and abstract. The DNA of techno and electro are in there somewhere, but Booth and Brown have largely abandoned traditional melody and harmony in favor of raw sound design.</p>\n<p><em>Elseq 1-5</em> is not Autechre\u2019s first foray into download-only releases. 2008\u2019s <em>Quarstice</em> was followed by a series of digital EPs that offered expanded and alternate mixes, which were often superior to that album\u2019s edited material. Last year, the duo posted a series of nine recent live recordings of new material for sale online. An important part of Autechre\u2019s identity\u00a0has been the duo\u2019s willingness to mess with its audience\u2019s perceptions. A track might register as repetitive, yet never actually repeat itself. Another might repeat the same phrase for 20 minutes at a stretch. Other works have been so chaotic that it is nearly impossible to retain them in your memory.</p>\n<p>The set\u2019s second installment is the most extreme, with Booth and Brown delving into crunchy, headache-generating digressions in 10-minute chunks that will feel either exhausting or exhilarating. \u201ceastre\u201d kicks off the third grouping with nearly a quarter-hour of droning, unearthly string tones. Not all of it is engaging, but if you ever wondered what it would really mean for Autechre to take an uninhibited plunge into the weirdo void, now you have your answer.</p>\n<p><em>Elseq</em> feels like an advancement of the duo\u2019s recent live sets, offering a similar ratio of rhythm to noise and order to chaos, but a richer palette of sounds.\u00a0There aren\u2019t a lot of melodies to be heard, but there are a number of distinctive tones and tricks\u2014percussive thumps that sound like collapsing cardboard boxes, gritty woofer-busting bass tones. At the start of \u201cpendulu hv moda\u201d a reverb effect seems to move rapidly between wet and dry, spacious and tight, creating the dizzying sensation that space is expanding and contracting in time with the music. The best tracks land perfectly in the DMZ between the mechanical and musical. On \u201cfoldfree casual,\u201d shimmering chords at first register as sentimental, but become more repetitive and emotionally vacant as they are pushed into the wings by jittery and alien rhythms.</p>\n<p>As a live act, Autechre is pretty much without parallel. In concert, the duo\u2019s music feels un-gridded and spontaneous in a way that few computer or drum machine-backed performers can manage. In its best stretches, <em>Elseq</em> seems like a document of this aspect\u00a0of Booth and Brown\u2019s process\u00a0\u2013 the part that\u2019s just two dudes taking pleasure in real-time collaborative music making. Which, in a way, might serve to deflate the futuristic vibe a little. All talk of robots and post-humanity aside, it\u2019s hard to think of\u00a0anything quite as earthly as a jam session.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>If the music of\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/\">Autechre</a>\u00a0has any kind of easy entry point, it's through the series of EPs they've released over the years. Often the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth have used the format to extend on the knotty ideas of whatever their latest LP happened to be at the time, although the results are not always concise. The runtime for the download-only EP <em>Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae</em> is around the 150-minute mark. On 1994's <em>Anti</em> EP\u00a0 they even took a political stance, using their music to protest the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which was passed in the U.K. as a measure to curb the &quot;repetitive beats&quot; of illegal raves. Autechre's response was to program a series of non-repetitive beats across the track &quot;Flutter&quot;.</p>\n<p>The music on their EPs isn't always typical of their career, but it does highlight how the format has afforded Brown and Booth room to edge away from the dense constructs that consume their time elsewhere. The sheer amount of music on this year's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17691-autechre-exai/\"><em>Exai</em></a> can seem daunting at first, even for Autechre fans who are reasonably comfortable with every turn they've taken. Long albums are rarely an instant thrill, but for this duo even single tracks can take a vast amount of time to unravel. It's one of the most beautiful aspects of Autechre, whose music still sounds like it's being beamed back to us from some impossibly brutal future, but a future that's actively working against the short-attention-span present.</p>\n<p><em>L-event</em> isn\u2019t a world away from the <em>Exai</em> material. It's not passive listening. Autechre work operates at a high level of engagement, requiring a commitment from the listener that's as great as the detail poured into the music. That holds true across their output, and only seems to increase with each passing record. Here, all the edges are a little sharper, although the level of decay has decreased since the collapsed-world framework they set up for 2008's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11245-quaristice/\"><em>Quaristice</em></a>. The standout &quot;Newbound&quot; from this EP links to the same kind of duality felt in the excellent <em>Exai</em> cut &quot;Bladelores&quot;, where hope and futility battle against one another. It's in that kind of suggestion that the best Autechre material works, where the haywire circuitry gradually unravels with a strange kind of purpose.</p>\n<p>Not all of <em>L-event</em> is quite so rewarding. &quot;Osla for n&quot; comes closest to payoff, initially resembling an asthmatic computer descending into delirium before the ideas tail off before the end. If <em>Exai</em> needed editing it was in the individual track lengths as opposed to the overall work. &quot;Osla for n&quot; follows the pattern set by a track like &quot;veKoS&quot; from that album, where the focus begins to slip by the middle and then drifts into aimless contemplation. At least on &quot;tac Lacora&quot; they demonstrate how well they can still transform their overriding preoccupation with digital interference into sound, although there is a creeping sense that Brown and Booth are looping back on themselves, returning to ground they've already covered in abundance. Still, they remain lone operators out here, <a href=\"http://p.autechre.ws/proxy?lnk=pitchfork.com\">liquefying the internet</a> one website at a time, continually enamored with the breaking point of technology.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/\">Autechre</a>\u00a0neither make casual music, nor do they make music casually: The English duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth have released 11 albums under the name in\u00a0the last 20 years,\u00a0along with a chain of EPs that have generally been as integral to their evolution as the long-players. All of those albums easily pass the one-hour hurdle; 2008's excellent <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11245-quaristice/\"><em>Quaristice</em></a> comprised 20 relatively brief tracks cut from hours of extended jamming, but it still clocked in just shy of 74 minutes. In 2010, the two enthusiasts offered a <a href=\"http://percussionlab.com/sets/autechre/12_hour_radio_broadcast\">webcast</a> of an exhilarating 12-hour DJ set, pogoing from hip-hop and indie rock to industrial and electronica. (One short and emblematic sequence incorporated Eno and Byrne, RZA, Coil, and Boards of Canada.) A certain charm of Autechre has always been that they love music <em>and</em> they love making music; even at their most clinical, this zeal has remained an inherent premise.</p>\n<p>In the last decade, the Manchester duo rewrote their own rules, leaning on the risks of their early works until, by their eighth\u00a0LP\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/368-untilted/\">Untilted</a></em>, it was clear that their intention was no longer simply making bodies move, though that was sometimes a by-product. If Autechre's earliest records were typically classified as intelligent dance music, their later efforts might best be dubbed intelligence-enabled dance music-- with eclectic touchstones absorbed and dissolved, they did whatever they wanted. &quot;I think there's always this competitive freshness that we're trying to achieve,&quot; Brown <a href=\"http://www.barcodezine.com/Autechre%20Interview.htm\">told an interviewer</a> around the time of <em>Quaristice</em>'s release. &quot;That's all there is in terms of statement or communication.&quot;</p>\n<p>But for all their influence, energy and innovation, Autechre have never been very good editors. Their EPs are the length of most bands' albums, while their albums run about as long as short feature films. If you hear an interesting sound or idea from Autechre, you're bound to hear it again and again before a track's end. Despite their creative restlessness, Brown and Booth have never been very good at moving on their music itself. These qualities dovetail to the detriment of <em>Exai</em>, the band's eleventh record-- and, by a margin of about 40 minutes, its longest. Though it's often interesting, <em>Exai</em> is insufferably exhausting, a record imprisoned by the obsessions of those who made it.</p>\n<p>Five years ago, in an\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6788-autechre/\">interview with Pitchfork</a>, Brown said that the possibilities of technology had made music production intimidatingly infinite. A key to productivity, he implied, was setting limits and aims. &quot;You've got to be realistic,&quot; he said. &quot;You can sit in front of a computer and have a blank slate and be completely overwhelmed by the possibilities and not get anywhere.&quot; Whereas 2010's wonderfully muted and warm\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14051-oversteps/\"><em>Oversteps</em></a>\u00a0found a path and followed it,\u00a0<em>Exai</em> is a behemoth devoid of focus, an album on which the tough decisions about direction and, later, elimination have not been made. There are bass-heavy beaters that suggest the pair's earlier works, and amorphous drone numbers that don't; there are glitchy sprints that chirp, and menacing slogs that haunt. Just one of its 17 tracks doesn't break the four-minute mark, and many slingshot between various sounds and schemes, meaning that the transitions within the album and the songs themselves are weak, if not nonexistent. Pieces shift into bridges that lead nowhere (&quot;T ess xi&quot;), suddenly mix their metaphors and mechanics (the end of &quot;recks on&quot;) and wallow in aesthetic indecision (tone-setting opener &quot;FLeure&quot;).</p>\n<p>There's nothing actually\u00a0<em>wrong</em>\u00a0with the sounds on\u00a0<em>Exai</em>: Though they don't turn many new tricks, Autechre have once again proven to be top-notch sonic magpies and brilliant technicians. &quot;Irlite (get 0)&quot; makes a synthesizer sound like a church organ overrun by the ghosts in the graveyard, while &quot;T ess xi&quot; employs fluorescent soul keyboards as its basic building block. &quot;deco Loc&quot; turns someone's voice inside out, creating beautiful textures and themes from a sound salvaged and forcibly repurposed. The drums splashed over the surface of &quot;Runrepik&quot; suggest sun-warped crunk singles. Its chaser, &quot;spl9&quot;, is an industrial crucible where the ruptures of power electronics and the force of dubstep are heated until they ricochet off one another. Brown and Booth are familiar with each other's habits, and wary of them, too. &quot;T ess xi&quot; showcases a sort of rhythmic volleyball between the pair, where several seemingly simple beats tease one another, shifting so as to avoid anything so obvious as a groove.\u00a0Likewise, &quot;vekoS&quot; ends when its subaquatic beat surrenders slowly to a tide of overwhelming static. On an album of erratic shifts and very few segues, it's a moment of impossible tension.</p>\n<p>Arguing that an album offers\u00a0<em>too much</em>\u00a0music seems pass\u00e9 at best, entirely irrelevant at worst. Aren't records just old-fashioned methods of assembling information, arbitrary holding tanks for material that could be released in online formats that don't adhere to time limitations or sequencing expectations? Possibly, and perhaps Autechre is once again ahead of a curve that we barely recognize. But that doesn't solve\u00a0<em>Exai</em>'s fundamental problem: Some of its songs deserve to be cut into halves, while others should have been chopped wholesale. With those snips, <em>Exai</em> would be a really good Autechre album that summarizes the various successes of their career in an hour or so. As is, it's as much a frustrating obstacle course as it is a grueling marathon.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>This might seem like the most daunting release of 2011, the very definition of for-fans-only. After all, Autechre made their name by separating those dabbling in electronic music from the truly hardcore. Compared to the rest of Warp's early post-rave/home-listening acts, they were challenging from the start, and their releases only grew more complex and less user-friendly as the years went on. This box set collects 47 tracks from 11 years of Sean Booth and Rob Brown's hyper-productive output. If one EP of Autechre's dense sound art seems forbidding, try about a dozen of them.</p>\n<p>And yet. Autechre's late-career complexity is in no way overstated. Albums like 2001's <em>Confield</em> sometimes threaten to abandon form and structure entirely for the pure delight of manipulating digital noise into an endless array of different shapes. Other records are so madly patterned, like multiple electro tracks layered into a writhing whole, that following the duo's logic can be nearly impossible. But perhaps nodding to their roots in club sounds, or having fun with the very idea of this sort of band releasing &quot;singles,&quot; Autechre's EPs have offered some of their most accessible music, even if you have to stretch the definition of &quot;accessible&quot; to the breaking point. Dizzying as it may be as a whole, this box is in a weird way one of the better introductions to the duo's work.</p>\n<p>The earliest EPs here, 1991's\u00a0<em>Cavity Job</em> and 1994's\u00a0<em>Basscadet</em>, aren't far off from labelmate Aphex Twin's first forays into tweaked acid. &quot;Cavity Job&quot; opens with a blast of dental drill noise as abrasive as Whitehouse, but quickly launches into a frantic rave tune that would have fit just fine at the era's more hardcore clubs. The four &quot;Basscadet&quot; mixes are where things start to get hairy-- moving from jittery techno to haunted ambient-- but the duo's\u00a0pulsing funk has yet to be shattered the way it soon would be. The average set of human feet may object to the logic of these beats, but they sure are head-nodders. And as far afield from the genre as they would eventually get, Autechre's love for early hip-hop's trunk-rattling low-end and turntable gymnastics are all over these EPs. &quot;Goz Quarter&quot; from 1997's <em>Envane</em> EP plays like a playful scratch record made from scraps of digital noise. They're reminders of a time when the borders of hip-hop and what was known (for better or worse) as IDM weren't so ruthlessly policed.</p>\n<p>So there's plenty of pleasure here, but plenty of difficulty as well. As the years went on, Autechre became masters of bright melodies that they then drowned in distortion-- their own abstract variation on &quot;noise pop.&quot; 1999's <em>EP7</em> might be their most beautiful release, but it's also one of their most disorienting, built from what seems like several hundred gigs worth of glittering little chunks of sound. From then on, Autechre's music would be about things endlessly falling apart and rebuilding themselves and falling apart again in spectacular fashion. On &quot;Gantz Graf&quot;, one of their most convoluted beat-and-riff creations becomes subjected to so much abuse that it collapses into screaming noise, as if the track itself is pleading for relief. There's a lot more to <em>listen</em> to in Autechre's later music, and a lot less to hang onto. The music constantly mutates, so it's hard to get bored, but if your attention drifts, it becomes ever harder to figure out how you got from one minute to the next. It's no wonder they were embraced as much by the free improv community around the turn of the millennium. It's music that invites a listener to boggle at its moment-to-moment inventiveness or tune it out entirely.</p>\n<p>What's really surprising, listening back to these EPs after so many changes in techno style, is how fresh they still sound. Autechre were often praised for the &quot;alien&quot; quality of their music, the way they processed and distorted their synth sounds and programmed beats until they became unfamiliar, and in retrospect it was the best thing they could have done to ensure their music didn't date itself. Only the <em>Cavity Job</em> sounds truly bound to the era of its release. And even the elements that became IDM clich\u00e9s, like all those thin, tiny beats bouncing madly around the mix, are underused enough now that younger listeners might just hear them as new. So many of the duo's peers have disappeared from the 21st century musical conversation, but Autechre persist. That's partly because they're workhorses who never stopped putting out records, but mostly, it's because even their most fearsome records have a striking beauty and weird compulsive listenability that few of their contemporaries could match.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>It's not unusual for Autechre to go a couple of years between full-lengths. So two in the span of a couple of months-- Sean Booth and Rob Brown have never released two Autechre albums in a single year-- is a pretty big deal. Why the quick follow-up to <em>Oversteps</em>? From the sound of these two records, it seems possible that Booth and Brown generated a large batch of material in the two years since <em>Quaristice</em> and decided to split it into complementary records, each with a different focus. While <em>Oversteps</em> had a number of drifting, ambient pieces mixed in with rhythm-oriented tracks that at times nodded toward dubstep, <em>Move of Ten</em> puts its emphasis on sharp beats that mostly stay within conventional meters. With these two records following on the more variable <em>Quaristice</em>, an album of shorter tracks that seemed to touch on almost every sound they've ever tried, that makes three pretty different albums in a row for Autechre, which is encouraging.</p>\n<p>I say &quot;pretty different&quot; because we're not talking about records that sound like they could have come from completely different artists. Even if the title of opening track &quot;Etchogon-S&quot; didn't clue you in to who we're dealing with, the skittering half-broken beat and sharp synth stabs that verge on sounding random would do the trick. The track almost seems designed to inspire a &quot;Yep, sounds like Autechre&quot; sigh from its first few seconds, which isn't going to bring back anyone who tuned out somewhere around the time of 2001's <em>Confield</em>. Autechre have fiercely loyal fans who look forward to whatever they do next, but my sense is that they used to attract a lot more of the merely curious than they do now. And for those who followed along for a record or two a decade ago before finding more pleasure in something like, say, Four Tet, there's little here to bring them back in the fold. Autechre still specialize in dense, complicated, and texturally rich sounds that upend ideas of what music might be. Word that they are continuing these experiments while bringing 4/4 beats into the mix won't be enough for most.</p>\n<p>But for those who want to give them another try, this is the most forceful Autechre record in a while. Their beats are stripped down and hit a little harder, and their skewed takes on dance music-- techno and especially electro-- are convincing. Autechre's love of electro and the production of old school hip-hop producer Kurtis Mantronik in particular has been a steady source of inspiration since their inception. When you listen to Mantronik's productions for Mantronix or rapper Just-Ice, you get a sense of just what Autechre heard in his music: The sharp crack of the era's drum machines and the wild stabs of synth both sound very 80s and also like another era's interpretation of the future. They also sound like brilliant examples of urban culture using discarded bits of its past in a new way.</p>\n<p>Certain tracks here, like &quot;pce freeze 2.8i&quot; with its booming low-end snapped tightly into a computer grid or &quot;rew(1)&quot; with its slippery alien bassline and hissy electronic handclaps, sound like they could be the instrumental realization of the new century being imagined 25 years ago. This stuff is strange and eerie and off-kilter but still in its own way funky, and it's the kind of thing Booth and Brown have always done better than just about anyone else. &quot;M62&quot; with its steady kickdrums and jittery but warm synths is a warm and inviting bit of Detroit-style electro in the vein of Drexciya, where the following &quot;ylm0&quot; is the album's &quot;pretty&quot; track, sounding a bit like a Boards of Canada interlude playback powered by double the suggested voltage.</p>\n<p>At 10 songs and 47 minutes, <em>Move of Ten</em> is relatively lean and digestible. There's none of the formal innovation that Autechre were doing around the turn of the millennium, but for my money that's a good thing. They claimed their new ground long ago, and since then they've been growing new music on it. Some of it has been excellent, some a shadow of past glories. With the addition of this solid LP, the 2010 harvest suggests that the soil has a few seasons in it yet.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>After more than two decades of recording together as Autechre, Sean Booth and Rob Brown can still create the aural equivalent of whiplash if they want to, or showcase a deep knowledge of dance music. The production duo's energetic 12-hour online radio broadcast from earlier this month-- joyfully tweeted about and linked to by fans-- was a massive, almost exhausting display of influences and favorites. Floating between Coil and Lord Quas, the mix inspired someone to crowdsource the track list on Google Docs.</p>\n<p><em>Oversteps</em> takes a much quieter approach, focusing on a smaller scale. Coming after 2008's <em>Quaristice</em>, a varied collection of shorter tracks that originated during live jam sessions, <em>Oversteps</em> leans toward some of the slower, more atmospheric aspects of albums like\u00a0*Amber (*minus the metered pulse). After the album's initial 20 seconds of silence, the opener &quot;r ess&quot; slowly surfaces-- cold, distant synths arc overhead while broken, incomplete rhythms clatter and collide-- seemingly suggesting that steady beats aren't the main focus here.</p>\n<p>Many tracks, such as &quot;O=0&quot; and &quot;d-sho qub&quot;, do contain propulsive rhythms, and a slow funk and dull handclap seep through &quot;Treale&quot;. But the textures are where things get interesting. Whether it's from tones floating in space or notes brushing up against each other in quiet but effective dischord, the ambience and atmospheres of <em>Oversteps</em> are haunting. &quot;st epreo&quot; expands and contorts with bass notes that seem bound to the rules of fluid dynamics. &quot;Yuop&quot; steadily builds and crests with ringing, grandiose synths. Sometimes, the lack of propulsion distracts, like on &quot;pt2ph8&quot;. But the overlapping round of notes in &quot;see on see&quot; points to a clear design within the synthetic ether.</p>\n<p>Autechre have evoked heavy moods while pushing the possibilities of production technology forward and broadening the vocabulary of electronic music. The famous video for their track &quot;Gantz Graf&quot; suggests as much, that they harnessed the grating sounds of a machine in the middle of a grand mal seizure. <em>Oversteps</em> finds them working in a comparatively less rigid fashion, almost organic compared to something like <em>Confield.</em> Focusing on creating tension and release within their compositions, they're still incorporating new designs, not merely repackaging the previous products.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>There was a time in the late 1990s when Autechre embodied one way of thinking about music's future. Producers exploring the infinite possibilities of increasingly complex software were creating new sounds on an almost weekly basis. Autechre were recognized as the leading edge of this clan. Their music, while not always alien in terms of texture-- they've often favored timbres that reference electro and early techno in one way or another-- was difficult to get a handle on; the beats were hard to follow; the spaces in which the music breathed impossible to define. Music this strange was only possibly through accelerating technology, and you got the idea that Autechre's music would continue to accelerate in parallel. They were pioneers.</p>\n<p>One of the ironies of Autechre a decade on is that they still more or less occupy the same position, while trends in experimental music have drifted elsewhere. While some laptop producers began to think about songs again-- working with vocalists, putting their own spin on krautrock, or seeing how shoegaze might sound coming through a computer-- a younger generation came at abstraction in an analog frame of mind. They began with crude electronics, incorporated tribal metaphors, and forewent the beautiful pure math of the circuit board for the messy concerns of the body; instead of shaved heads, they sported wild hair and beards and maybe a bit of face paint.</p>\n<p>I thought of these contrasts with regard to <em>Quaristice</em>, Autechre's first new album in three years, when listening to &quot;The Plc&quot;, the album's second track, which follows the ghostly synth-drone opener &quot;Altibzz&quot;. &quot;The Plc&quot;'s reference point is electro-- the stiff and mannered snare drum, seemingly fashioned from tin, marks every measure robotically. But swirling around the steady-state beat are a number of odd sounds that lend a decidedly psychedelic cast. In purely sonic terms, it's not all that far from something like Excepter in their more beat-oriented mode, but Autechre's way of getting there couldn't be more different, and process is in part what defines them.</p>\n<p>Autechre's research-and-development-style approach to music making is one of the things they're known for, but <em>Quaristice</em> is said to be special in that regard. Instead of focusing on the micro, painstakingly stitching together each track second-by-second, this album grew out of jamming, with Sean Booth and Rob Brown reconfiguring and &quot;versioning&quot; elements of their by all accounts formidable live show into new tunes. It's hard to tell exactly how that plays out, but one thing about this record is very different from anything else Autechre has done this decade: The tracks are short (most around three or four minutes) and there are lots of them (20).</p>\n<p>While it's tempting to think of this collection of sonic miniatures as a set of &quot;singles,&quot; <em>Quaristice</em> winds up working in almost the opposite way. Since the bulk of these pieces each explores one focused idea without a lot of variation, they don't make a whole lot of sense when removed from the album. Autechre have always made music of changes, where part of the interest was in hearing the gears of the music slipping as rhythms fell in and our of sync with each other and wound up somewhere different from where they began; development within most of the tracks on <em>Quaristice</em> is smaller and less noticeable, and many are over before you know it. So it might be more useful to think of the short tracks as sort of miniature movements within the album's suite-like whole.</p>\n<p>Which is another way of saying that I've most enjoyed this record when I've had the time and focus to allow me to listen to the entire thing straight through. It's then I can follow the arc of the record as it moves from the billowy opening of &quot;Altibzz&quot; past the menacing, high-speed future-shock fuckery of &quot;IO&quot;, to the nervous ghost-in-the-machine drone of &quot;SonDEremawe&quot;, on through the positively AFX-ian &quot;Simmm&quot;-- with its wired gamelan percussion hits and too-bright melody that makes you think of an artificial sun-- stopping along the way for the towering beat and acid riff of &quot;Rale&quot;, the disorienting implosion of &quot;Fol3&quot;, and the double-speed Detroit assembly line of &quot;bnc Castl&quot;.</p>\n<p>As they move from ambient washes to classic-sounding IDM to their usual variations on techno and electro, I'm hearing more overt referencing of sounds of the past on <em>Quaristice</em>, like Autechre are more readily glancing and poking at genre, perhaps in an attempt to escape the oppression of so much focus on detail. So <em>Quaristice</em> also feels a bit like a survey, an esoteric and abstracted summary of electronic music's past that also glances toward what might come. After the hyper techno of &quot;chenc9&quot;, the album folds back in on itself in the final two tracks, allowing space for contemplation of where the music has been. &quot;Notwo&quot; is so moody it almost sounds like Angelo Badalamenti; with its a dubby underwater drone and clipped upper range, it wouldn't sound out of place on <em>Amber</em>. And then lengthy &quot;Outh9X&quot; finishes the album on a more neutral note, as a steady electronic pulse is stalked by bassy tones that eventually trail off into mist in an extended ambient coda.</p>\n<p>It's been some time since we've heard Autechre sounding as purely beautiful as the opening and two closing tracks on <em>Quaristice</em>, but these moments aren't indicative of the record as a whole. Even while *Quaristice * is in some ways the most listenable album they've created in a decade, it's ultimately no easier to parse, and can be very rough going indeed if you're not in the mood for their peculiar world. Ultimately, this is still the same Autechre, remaining apart from trends as the rest of electronic music world goes on its way, their steadfast commitment to their vision being both their greatest strength and most confounding obstacle.</p>\n",

Yes? I'm referring to the object, though small in size, quite interesting in stature, I am holding in front of you now.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> It's a CD.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Brilliant! I can see I have come to the right man.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> ...</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Never one for suspense, I'll begin the next phase of our conversation: It is a new album from one of my country's most respected groups of musicians, Autechre.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> And I am holding it in my hands.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay. Yeah, I heard a new one was coming out or something.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Or something indeed, for I think it may be their best. Better even than the fine <em>Confield</em>. Do you remember the one?</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Yeah, to be honest, I kinda stopped listening to them a few years back. I liked the first one, I think I liked <em>EP7</em>. I don't really remember much about it.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> I would happily grant you a very big favor in return for a moment of your time as I explain to you my thoughts on this record. Might you humor me?</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Hey, hand that to me. Over here. Thanks. Yeah, whatever.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Thank you. For starters, it's called <em>Untilted</em>. Isn't that funny? &quot;<em>Un-til-ted</em>.&quot; They really do have a good sense of humor, don't you think?</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Um, not really. It's kind of stupid.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Well, I think it's a decent title all the same. But funnier still, I will admit, is that it's comprised of eight letters.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh shit, yeah, that's hilarious.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Which is to say, funny when I recall that their previous album's title was also comprised of exactly eight alphanumeric characters (not counting the colon, of course). As was the full length before that-- <em>Confield</em>. Don't you think that's strange?</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> No.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> And even stranger still, Autechre-- A-U-T-E-C-H-R-E-- has the identical number of characters. Why, when I happened upon this, I was struck by the similarity in form.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay, way to go off the deep end. Are you going to tell me now that they're geniuses and I can learn trig faster by listening to them? I mean, what's funny is I might actually study to them more if I could hear a beat somewhere.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> As it happens, I do believe they are masters of form. But then I also believe they are as instinctively driven as any other musician, if that's not a contradiction (and I don't necessarily believe it is). Take &quot;Pro-Radii&quot;, the third track: It begins with pounding, industrial-machinery sounds, as if stomping through a foggy alley using meter-thick blocks of iron as shoe souls. Yet, it slowly mutates into something lighter, with stuttering snare and what sounds like a digital sitar drone in the background.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> You sound like a critic.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> And I haven't even gotten to the punchline! As it changes into something even further removed from the weighty opening, as eerie overtones ring above the pinging, metallic percussion, I realize the piece has arrived at this point in segments, lengthy and subtle, but obviously delineated to be sure. This, or course, is exactly the same scheme much of the dance music-- that with a &quot;beat&quot;-- follows. Measure by measure, units of 8, 16, 32, 64-- it proceeds formally, yet changes its &quot;colors&quot; quite unpredictably.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Hey, hand me my bag.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> And the first piece, &quot;Lcc&quot;--</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> haha</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> --&quot;Lcc&quot;, with its rapid-fire artillery precision, tight snare, and <em>clear, metered</em> rhythm, could easily be mistaken for dance music. In fact, I'd move some limbs for you, but would hate to influence your judgment negatively.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Next.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> Achilles, if you'd listen, you'd hear that the beat you are looking for is here, and an especially well-put-together one at that. Autechre are rightfully accused of being influenced by hip-hop, even as I imagine a rapper laying behind the beat might find himself on the wrong side of &quot;1&quot; from time to time.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> So, you're saying it's got an interesting beat as long as you don't expect any kind of groove. And you know what? It's not even like I'm turning to Autechre for &quot;grooves.&quot; Where the fuck did all the cool IDM even go? Like three years ago, you couldn't stop finding cool shit, shit that nobody'd ever heard before.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> I'm saying that interest is found where you are sufficiently motivated to look. &quot;Fermium&quot; would fit perfectly in the Berlin mix you made for your nephew. A little busier, perhaps, but...</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh man, I forgot I was supposed to copy that for that board chick. Fuck, hey, can I use your computer? The library's closed today.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> The point is, despite their abstraction over the last few years, Autechre aren't an altogether different beast than when they started. In fact, they're smarter, more refined.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Look, I'll grant you they sound more complicated, but so the fuck what? I mean, I heard <em>Draft 7:30</em>. I liked it at first, until I realized all this form and content or whatever you're talking about is totally transparent. Dance music? Come on man, you need a more than &quot;beat&quot; to make dance music. If anything, I think they're out of ideas; throwing in a bunch of random shit to hide the fact that they peaked about seven years ago.</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> My point is, I am still moved by this music. Not just the form, not just the hidden beats and seemingly chaotic shifts in meter. I believe artists are those who instinctively recognize the ways of things, and translate them in ways ultimately true to their spirit. Ours is a &quot;seemingly chaotic&quot; world, but underneath the maze of people and opinions, there is order, truth, and beauty. And maybe, just maybe, Autechre have the rare gift of showing us just where we stand, turbulence and all.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> And my point is, if it's driven by form, it's a pretty messy, lazy form-- certainly no more structurally sound than any other software wank music. On top of that, if I'm supposed to &quot;feel&quot; this, to pick up on some obscure metaphysical in-joke, I'm not-- isn't it the job of a good artist to make that shit clear? Either way, it fails for me. Autechre decided to go their own way, fine, you know, just don't expect me to call them &quot;geniuses.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Tortoise:</em> [<em>Sigh</em>] Alright, Achilles, I can see we're going to have to agree to disagree. I'm sorry to have wasted your time.</p>\n<p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh don't worry, dude, just wear headphones when you play that stuff.</p>\n<p>(With all apologies to Douglas Hofstadter and <em>G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em>, which I'd send you if I had an extra copy.)</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>Drone: as with anything else that rarely changes, it's necessary to latch onto subtleties. What minimal suggestion put forth by a drone is so easily applied to pretty much any impression you might have that, predictably, describing one often leads to vague subjectivities bordering on bad poetry. And as much as I'd love to go around proclaiming my love for &quot;deeply resonant, holy abysses&quot; (not), I wish there were an easier way to communicate the real power of the things.</p>\n<p>England's Hafler Trio are no strangers to an elusive clarity; rather, Andrew Mackenzie isn't. Mackenzie is the only current member of the self-dubbed h\\xB3o, a group that at no point was actually comprised of three people-- unless you count their &quot;collaborators&quot;, like imaginary scientists Robert Spridgeon or Dr. Edward Moolenbeek, both of whom were fabricated by Mackenzie and founding member Chris Watson (ex-Cabaret Voltaire) for their fairly astounding 1984 debut, <em>Bang! An Open Letter</em>. On that album, and on many early Hafler Trio recordings, tape edits and loops, found sound and Residents-style Dadaism ruled the day. Since Watson's departure in the late 80s, Mackenzie has gravitated more towards experimental ambient and drone music.</p>\n<p>Autechre, on the other hand, seem to have been moving in the opposite direction. 2003's <em>Draft 7.30</em> might have been slightly more straightforward than 2001's extraordinary <em>Confield</em>, but could hardly have been further from ambient if it tried. Even the moments that might conceivably have been called &quot;drone&quot; (parts of &quot;Surripere&quot;, for example) seemed skittish and nervous. Certainly a far cry from anything on the Autechre/Hafler Trio split aptly titled, <em>ae\\xB3o &amp; h\\xB3ae</em>, a daunting exercise in ominous hum, icy space and digital resonance. In fact, I had a hard time locating anything obviously Autech'd, whereas the album has much in common with recent Hafler releases such as the <em>Moment When We Blow Flour from Our Tongues</em> EP.</p>\n<p>&quot;ae\\xB3o&quot; begins as a high-pitched, muffled scream, clearly emanating from the cold circulatory system of a computer and without the slightest notion of making you feel all warm inside. Soon, what seems like white noise fills in the space beneath, and a bass-heavy generator noise becomes dominates. It reminds me of sound-sculptor Richard Chartier's album on American experimental electronic label Crouton from last year-- Hafler Trio have also recorded for Crouton, and fans of modern dark ambient and electronic will have much to investigate on their roster. &quot;ae\\xB3o&quot; moves through long periods of relative calm (if you consider residual static hum calm), but never comes to a point of resolution. It's bleak, in the way any lack of root is bleak. It could also be endlessly fascinating in a chemically altered state.</p>\n<p>The second piece, &quot;h\\xB3ae&quot;, begins unassumingly with what sounds like a distant wind. Listening closer, there's also a faint sonar whistle, gradually growing louder. Then, the unison growl of jet engines overtakes the introductory ambience, eventually expanding into a massive howl. It sounds as if I'm being sucked into a giant black hole, passing through faster and faster, until nothing is really clear except that there doesn't appear to be a light on the other side. Midway through the 15-minute track, things become calmer for a short period, as the &quot;engine&quot; noises give way to the sound of actual flight. However, again a gradual increase in volume and depth is used as a device to reel me further into the cavernous house of mirrors that is the artists' preferred workshop. The track ends with the only rhythmically active section on the CD, as the previous noises are cut up into short, clipped propulsions before settling on a single distorted buzz-drone.</p>\n<p>Although Autechre and Mackenzie need little excuse to dive into the abstract, <em>ae\\xB3o &amp; h\\xB3ae</em> is, as these things go, relatively accessible. For starters, there's much variation over the course of the two lengthy pieces, and things never really approach either pure noise or pure ambience. It's not the kind of record I'd play to chill out, but since there are hundreds of small details to focus on, anyone willing to block out some quality listening time (and not in need of any unnecessary &quot;songs&quot;) could become quickly engrossed. Musically, it's consistently interesting, if a tad cold, so I'd recommend it with the caveat that you shouldn't expect much of a helping hand from the bands.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>In wondering how to get my head around Autechre's new CD, it never occurred to me that this music might not lend itself very well to aggressive analysis. Not every piece of music begs for intellectual immersion, and of course, not every listener is ready to conduct such an extensive investigation. In fact, most people probably don't waste much time with these things at all, so why should I? I remember how looking for patterns in <em>Confield</em> basically got me nowhere, except to notice that chaos isn't as perfect, crystalline as its made out to be by misunderstood mathematicians and restless musicians. <em>Confield</em>'s chaos was digital, but it was also a great mess in places, merely strangely beautiful in others. Yet, despite my considerable missing of the point (and for all I know, I still am), its spark was clear. Sean Booth and Rob Brown constructed a fiber-thin moonscraper of a system: I'm not sure any of it would stand up in the face of analysis, but most of it tears down my attempts without much effort.</p>\n<p>I've never heard Autechre's music, especially their more recent stuff, described as &quot;inspirational&quot; or &quot;brilliant&quot;, just &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;mathematical&quot; (and &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;distant&quot; and a catalog of other words that aren't technically bad, but are never written to mean anything good in music). Somehow, their chaos is &quot;complicated,&quot; while real-life chaos is a crisis, capable of changing lives. As I see it, <em>LP5</em>, <em>EP7</em> and <em>Confield</em> are near-miraculously compact capsules of a state that would, in nature, engulf everything in its paths, and maybe as a consequence, something few people would want to approach.</p>\n<p>Well, it just so happens <em>Draft 7.30</em> is a return to form for folks who thought all that gibberish I spouted over <em>Confield</em> was, well, gibberish. If you're old enough to remember beats, none of the ones on this record will escape your ear. Also caught are bits of melody that, rather than obscured behind nine layers of software, are often heard in broad daylight. And another thing: even with an hour of pristine, possibly perfect edifices of light and head-bobbing structures, it's possible you don't notice the music is playing.</p>\n<p>At this point, <em>Draft 7.30</em> makes its most powerful impressions via the noise it fends off rather than the tunes it emits. &quot;Theme of Sudden Roundabout&quot; (in a rare populist move with coherent titling) lays its squelching beat down for all to see, and its melody, efficient in the extreme, is faintly reminiscent of the minimal watercolor of their more tuneful labelmates. Dispensing with the systematic analysis, I'd say it's pleasant, but not essentially interesting, a bit like the ultimate IDM museum piece, <em>Clicks &amp; Cuts</em>-- although, Autechre are hardly producing &quot;micro&quot; music of any kind here. This is Macro is the truest sense, and yet, despite its intricate thousands of details, few combinations produce that old kinetic spark.</p>\n<p>The opener &quot;Xylin Room&quot; hits an uptempo, polyrhythmic stutter beat to the tune of Autechre's patented thud-bass and various cut-up synth noises, all in and out, over and tumble, as if the arrangement could never be made busy <em>enough</em>. But a fucked-up beat is a beat nonetheless, and when the actual &quot;xylin&quot;phones hit, it's clear that this tune might well be the duo's take on bossa nova. It's a hard way to wrench a groove out of static air, but to me it sounds pretty convincing, so even if it fails to fill a dancefloor, it holds the ear at home. &quot;IV VV IV VV VIII&quot; is back to <em>Confield</em> school, albeit slightly stripped down. Somehow, the duo manages to obscure the beat without ever covering it up entirely, off-center snare slaps and cavernous echo notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>It's not all beat-fuckery, for once, as the brief &quot;Tapr&quot; proves. It begins with the drop of a plexus on glitched-up vinyl, more reverb, seemingly random synth tones and a whirlwind of low thuds and piano altered to an almost unrecognizable degree. Without pause, this ornery vignette segues into the epic, relentlessly varied &quot;Surripere&quot;. Over its ten-plus minute course, a fairly simple electro-funk backbeat is transformed into chattering, squishing metallic flutter, the end result of which doesn't so much resolve to the duo's usual silver-blue noise as bump up against a brick wall, as if they just ran out of ways to mess with the same group of semiquavers. Fittingly, at best, it's a move towards the brink despite frustratingly stationary stretches; at worst, it might not be worth the time.</p>\n<p>Of course, as with most Autechre releases, there will probably be considerable differences in reception for <em>Draft 7.30</em>. Since it doesn't break much new ground, there will be many who dismiss it quickly (perhaps without giving it a fair shake); others will be only too glad to see Booth and Brown return to more straightforward grounds, even if they don't quite reach their mid-90s peak as melodic technicians; still others may hear a logical progression from <em>Confield</em>, pointing to the group's use of a similar sound palette to make a very different journey. My guess is that there's some truth in all of those viewpoints, though in the end, I'm left with the sinking feeling that, as criticism goes, an unfortunate combination of familiar methods, beats and timbres won't overshadow the ultimately uninspiring music.</p>\n",

                "en": "<p>At press time, there seem to be two predominant attitudes about Autechre. The first is that they're one of the brightest, most consistently interesting outfits in IDM, and records like <em>EP7</em> or <em>LP5</em> define the present state of electronic dance music. The other is that Autechre's overly clinical approach puts them in grave danger of running their busy-beat shtick into the ground. 2001's <em>Confield</em>, despite its mention as one of Pitchfork's 20 best albums of last year, practically defined what it means to get mixed reviews. You could almost split its audience down the middle into those who were down with the avant-trip, and those who found it unengaging and devoid of visceral emotion. I like the album, but even I would admit that emotion isn't the first thing that comes to mind when listening to it.</p>\n<p>So when you're not sure whether you've stimulated or alienated your audience, what do you do? In Autechre's case, they've gone back to basics. The music on their freshly released five-inch, three-song EP, <em>Gantz Graf</em>, finds them revisiting the 'D' in IDM, as they have to varying extents on just about every release prior to <em>Confield</em>. Does that mean they were listening to their detractors last year? Or does it mean that they simply had some groove left in their brains after so much abstraction? Who knows? Maybe they were just dicking around in the studio and felt like releasing an EP.</p>\n<p><em>Gantz Graf</em>'s opener and title track wastes very little time hitting you with over-the-top beats and a distorted mix. There's a punchy melody comprised of successive synth jabs and some of the usual glitch trickery. But this track will immediately catch the ears of folks expecting more random chin-stroking music, as during its first half it features <em>actual recognizable beats</em>. Even the overdriven production can't obscure the clear rhythm. Of course, about a minute into the tune the beat begins to disintegrate, leaving only the melody to twinkle in the gaping void. Then, a while later, even that gets consumed by the twitching computer noise, and by the track's end, Autechre have locked us back inside their signature confusion and manic drill-glitch.</p>\n<p>&quot;Dial&quot; is the most straightforward song of the three, with a fast bounce-beat featuring some goofy organ patches and that snappy, Autechre-patented vacuum-pop rhythm track. If this song has any place in the canon of a band who were said to have sold their souls to the chaos theory devil with <em>Confield</em>, I don't know where it is, what with its similarity to 80s new wave quirk. It's a bit on the speedy side, otherwise you might even consider dancing to it. And deep in the mix lie some very treated vocals, though I can't decipher whether they're saying anything or just getting chopped up for the sake of filling out the arrangement. But at a runtime of just over six minutes, this is probably the closest the duo has come to straight club music since 1997's <em>Chiastic Slide</em>.</p>\n<p>The final track is the epic &quot;cap.iv,&quot; which finds the sound only slightly more abstract-- at least at first. The tempo is similar to that of &quot;Dial,&quot; though the beats are considerably more cluttered due to what sounds like a couple of competing electro-figures running concurrently. A straightforward piano line and an announcer who sounds stuck in a cavernous airport terminal play beneath the chattering percussion, adding a subtle but affecting texture. The track makes the Autechre strategy plain: lay an attractive backdrop behind restless, seemingly chaotic (emphasis on 'seemingly') blips and clicks. The backdrop here, however, is somewhat prettier than usual, and I wonder whether the beat that obscures it was only placed in front to appease fans of the tried-and-true Autechre way. As the track wears on, the intruding rhythms grow progressively louder and busier, and a good nine minutes later have utterly overwhelmed the other elements.</p>\n<p>The videos offered on <em>Gantz Graf</em>'s additional 5&quot; DVD disc-- including a revamped version of an older video by renowned Aphex director Chris Cunningham-- are of only marginal interest to fans, as they're no less abstract than the music. Chances are, you'll watch them once and shelve them indefinitely. And as for the music, nothing here should come as a surprise if you've been paying attention to Autechre's recent releases, unless you expected them to go even further out than <em>Confield</em>. My guess is that these tracks are just cool-downs from that album, or possibly warm-ups for the next, because other than the refinement of ideas they've already realized, there isn't much new to report.</p>\n",
