# pitchviews
Analysis of Pitchfork reviews and streaming data, final project for UTK COSC 545, Fundamentals of Digital Archaeology.

Data stored in pitchforkReviews.zip (as a csv). Exported from our DynamoDB to csv via [dynamoToCSV.py] (https://github.com/jtliso/pitchviews/blob/master/dynamoToCsv.py).

Numerical analyses Notebooks can be seen [here] (https://github.com/jtliso/pitchviews/tree/master/numerical_analyses). Although our [report] (https://github.com/jtliso/pitchviews/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20Pitchfork%20Reviews%20Final%20Report.pdf) does not use any textual analyses, our code for it can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/jtliso/pitchviews/tree/master/text_analyses).
